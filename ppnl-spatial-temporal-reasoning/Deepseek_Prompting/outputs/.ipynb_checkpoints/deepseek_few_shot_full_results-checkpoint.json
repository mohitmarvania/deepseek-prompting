Find the optimal path in a grid environment, avoiding obstacles while tracking position at each step. (0,0) is the top-left cell of the grid; (N-1,N-1) means N-1th row and N-1th column. Take your time to carefully analyze the grid configuration before planning the path.\n\n    Here are few examples:\n    ###\n    Task: You are in a 6 by 6 world. There are obstacles that you have to avoid at: (2,1). Go from (0,1) to (3,4)\n    Actions: right right right down down down\n    ###\n    Task: You are in a 6 by 6 world.

There are obstacles that you have to avoid at: (5,0).

The starting point here is (2,1), which is somewhere near the middle-top part of the grid since rows go vertically with higher numbers going down. My destination is (1,3), which seems closer but not too far either direction-wise. \n\nFirst off, let me visualize the grid. Since it's 6x6, there are indices from (0,0) at the top-left all the way to (5,5) at the bottom-right. So moving upwards decreases the first number, downwards increases it\u2014wait no, actually wait! Wait, sometimes grids can be confusing because depending on how they're represented. But according to the problem statement, (0,0) is the top-left corner, meaning if we move \"down\", our y-coordinate would increase? Or does movement depend more on standard Cartesian coordinates?\n\nWait, maybe better just think as per typical matrix indexing where increasing x moves to the right along columns, and increasing y moves downward through rows. Hmm... Actually, given that (0,0) is top-left, then for example:\n\n(0,0): top-left\n\nMoving Right goes to (0,1)\n\nMoving Down takes us to (1,0).\n\nSo yes, typically, when dealing with such coordinate systems, an increase in the second index corresponds to moving down or southwardly.\n\nBut perhaps another approach could help clarify things\u2014if someone gets confused later on whether Up/down affects their current Y value positively/negatively.\n\nIn any case, regardless of exact directions, my main focus now should be figuring out possible paths around the obstacle(s)\u2014in this task, only one obstacle exists at (5,0). That\u2019s pretty low\u2014it must mean something like fifth row, zero-th column. So looking towards the lower left area of the grid.\n\nStarting Point S = (2,1); Target T=(1,3). Let me plot these points mentally.\n\nS is two steps below the top edge, third column over. T is directly above S\u2014in terms of same X=column\u2014but three units away horizontally. Specifically, target is four squares to the east relative to start? No, hold on\u2014the Start has Column 1, Row 2. The Target is Column 3, Row 1. So difference between them is DeltaX +2, DeltaY \u20131.\n\nHmm, okay, so overall displacement requires moving Left twice and Up once\u2014or some combination thereof considering other constraints due to obstacles.\n\nNow, Obstacle is located at (5,0). Which is quite far from both source and target positions. So probably won't block direct routes unless forced otherwise.\n\nLet me consider potential paths.\n\nOption 1: Move straight upward toward the target. From (2,1):\n\nMove Up \u2192 (1,1);\n\nThen again Up\u2192 (0,1);\n\nFrom (0,1), trying to reach (1,3)... Well, cannot proceed further Up beyond (0,1) because next Up leads into negative Rows, which don\u2019t exist. Alternatively, after reaching (0,1), try moving East/East-East etc., but will that lead anywhere close enough?\n\nAlternatively, Option 2: Maybe take a detour via Columns instead of Rows.\n\nFor instance, Starting at (2,1):\n\nGo Right multiple times until reach desired Column, say Column 3;\n\nAt (2,1)->R->(2,2)-> R -> (2,3). Then see what happens.\n\nFrom (2,3), options include Moving Up, Down, Left, Right.\n\nIf I want to head towards (1,3), perhaps moving Up from (2,3) brings me to (1,3)? Yes!\n\nThat gives a total path: Right, Right, Up.\n\nWhich translates to 'RRU'.\n\nIs that correct?

Since it's a 6x6 grid, rows go from 0 to 5 vertically, and columns also from 0 to 5 horizontally.
