But according to the problem statement, (0,0) is the top-left corner, meaning if we move \"down\", our y-coordinate would increase?

Since it's a 6x6 grid, rows go from 0 to 5 vertically, and columns also from 0 to 5 horizontally.

The starting point here is (1,4), which if I remember correctly, rows go vertically and columns horizontally. So (1,4) would be one unit below the top-left corner since it's zero-indexed? Wait no, actually wait\u2014(0,0) is the top-left, meaning higher numbers for both increase as we move down-right. Hmm maybe not\u2014I should clarify how coordinates work here because getting confused might lead me astray.\n\nWait, let me think again. In grids like these, sometimes people use matrix notation where (row, column)\u2014so moving \"down\" increases the row number, but some systems consider movement differently based on screen orientation or something else. But according to the problem statement, (0,0) is the top-left, so probably increasing y goes downward when looking at the grid visually. Or perhaps x-axis moves along the bottom... No, more likely, standard Cartesian-like system with origin at top-left, positive x going right, positive y going down?\n\nSo given that, our start is (1,4): first row, fifth column assuming counting starts at 0. And end goal is (3,5): fourth row, sixth column. Obstacle is at (5,0).\n\nFirst thing\u2019s first\u2014the map itself isn't provided except through tasks. From previous examples:\n\nIn task two, there was an obstacle at (0,4); someone went from (5,4) to (2,4) using only upwards movements\u2014it makes sense they had to stay clear of whatever blocked their path elsewhere.\n\nBut now, my current scenario has different points. Let me visualize the grid mentally.\n\nLet me sketch what I know:\n\nGrid size: 6x6 cells, indices from (0,0) to (5,5).\nStarts at S=(1,4), ends at T=(3,5).\nObstacle O is at (5,0).\n\nI can\u2019t pass through O, nor anywhere else marked as having an obstacle\u2014but other than O, all others seem free unless specified otherwise.\n\nSince the user hasn't mentioned any other obstacles besides (5,0), I assume everything else is open space.\n\nNow, possible paths could involve various routes around the obstacle. Since the obstacle is located far away\u2014at the lower left corner\u2014isn't blocking much near the start or finish areas.\n\nHmm, okay, so thinking about allowed directions: Up, Down, Left, Right\u2014all four cardinal directions.\n\nStarting at (1,4):\n\nFrom (1,4):\nPossible initial steps include moving right towards (1,5), then further right until reach edge\u2014or backtracking left into (1,3)... Alternatively, moving up to (0,4), but considering whether that area is obstructed\u2014if nothing blocks between (0,4) and (1,4), why take extra risk? Maybe safer just to explore sideways initially.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is BFS (Breadth First Search) algorithm commonly used for shortest pathfinding in unweighted graphs\u2014which applies well here since every action costs same amount.\n\nGiven that, perhaps modeling positions reachable via BFS will help find minimal-length path.\n\nHowever, doing manual BFS may be tedious due to limited knowledge of exact grid state beyond single obstacle. But knowing that most parts are open allows certain assumptions.\n\nLooking at target location (3,5): It's three units down from start's Y-coordinate (since X=3 vs X=1?), wait hold on\u2014that depends on coordinate interpretation.\n\nIf (y,x) corresponds to (row,column), then (start)=(1,4)=Row 1, Column 4.\nTarget = (3,5)= Row 3, Column 5.\n\nTo get from (1,4)->(3,5), direction-wise needs to cover +2 Rows and +1 Column overall.\n\nPotential options:\n\nOption 1: Move down twice, then right once. That'd require checking if those intermediate squares are accessible.\n\nPositions after Step 1: Moving down from (1,4) \u2192 (2,4)\n\nStep 2: Again down\u2192 (3,4)\n\nThen right\u2192 (3,5). Is anything blocking these spots?\n\nCheck if any square among them is occupied by obstacle(s)? Only known obstacle is at (5,0). So none interfere directly.\n\nThus, seems feasible\u2014a straight line downwards followed by eastward.\n\nIs that correct though? Because depending on actual layout, even if direct path doesn't hit obstacle, does it cross over somewhere else unintentionally? Without seeing entire grid, hard to say, but per constraints, only specific obstacle exists.\n\nAnother option: Could also try moving East first instead of South.\n\nAt Start Point (1,4):\n\nMove right to (1,5), check if that's safe\u2014as long as (1,5) is empty, proceed.\n\nFrom (1,5), next choices: right leads off-grid (as max col index is 5?) Wait, Grid is 6x6, indexes run from 0\u20135 inclusive. Thus, maximum column is 5, hence cannot move right anymore.\n\nTherefore, alternative route from (1,5) must either turn south or north.\n\nMoving North brings us back to (1,4), which loops\u2014we don't want cycles.\n\nHence, better idea is to head South from (1,4) toward (2,4), etc., rather than trying to snake through.\n\nSimilarly, attempting to move West from (1,4) takes us to (1,3), but potentially leaving ourselves isolated later on.\n\nPerhaps exploring multiple avenues systematically helps prevent missing shorter paths.\n\nAlternative plan: Try expanding nodes level-by-level.\n\nLevel 0: Starting node (1,4).\n\nNeighbors available: All adjacent non-obstructed cells.\n\nWhich ones are neighbors?\nNorth: (0,4) \u2013 Unblocked.\nSouth: (2,4) \u2013 Unblocked.\nEast: (1,5) \u2013 Unblocked.\nWest: (1,3) \u2013 Unblocked.\n\nAll four directions are valid.\n\nProceeding Level 1: Each neighbor becomes part of Level 1.\n\nFor example,\n\nFrom (1,4)'s children:\n\nA. (0,4)\n   Neighbors: Can go South, East, West\n\nBecause above (0,4), moving North would exceed bounds.\n\nSame logic continues...\n\nThis process quickly gets complex manually, especially mapping all possibilities.\n\nInstead, focusing on the fact that the obstacle is quite distant\u2014from (5,0), whereas the desired path requires navigating mainly middle sections.\n\nConsidering that, perhaps the straightforward path is indeed viable.\n\nGoing down twice, then right once.\n\nThat gives Steps: D, D, R.\n\nResultant path length is 3 actions.\n\nChecking validity:\n\nEach step:\n\nD: (1,4) -> (2,4) \u2014 Clear.\n\nSecond D: (2,4) -> (3,4) \u2014 Also clear.\n\nR: (3,4) -> (3,5) \u2014 Clear.\n\nNo obstructions encountered during traversal.\n\nAdditionally, such a path uses minimum steps necessary, thus being efficient.\n\nAre there alternatives requiring fewer steps? Probably not, since Manhattan distance suggests needing min(\u0394Y+ \u0394X) steps\u2014in this case, delta-Y is 2, Delta-X is 1 \u21d2 total 3 steps needed regardless of order.\n\nAny deviation would result in longer path lengths.\n\nMoreover, since the obstacle is too far to affect nearby decisions, the safest bet is taking the quickest path.\n\nConclusion: Optimal path consists of moving down twice, then right once.\n</think>\n\nThe optimal path involves moving down twice and then right once to navigate from the starting point to the destination efficiently without encountering the obstacle.\n\n| summary |\n|----------|\n| optimal Path: [Down, Down, Right] |\n\n<think>\n\nAlright, let's break this down methodically.\n\n**Problem Overview:**  \nWe're tasked with finding the shortest path from (1,4) to (3,5) on a 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (5,0). Movement is restricted to Up, Down, Left, Right.\n\n**Understanding Coordinates:**  \nAssuming (0,0) is Top-Left, incrementing 'y' moves Downwards, and incrementing 'x' moves Rightwards.\n\n**Key Points:**  \n- Start: (1,4) => Second row, Fifth column.\n- End: (3,5) => Fourth row, Sixth column.\n- Obstacle: At (5,0) => Bottom-Left corner.\n\n**Analyzing Possible Paths:**  \nThere are several potential pathways, but efficiency is key. We'll evaluate feasibility and obstruction risks.\n\n### Option 1: Direct Downward and Rightward Path  \nSteps:  \n1. **Down**: Moves from (1,4) to (2,4).  \n2. **Down**: Moves from (2,4) to (3,4).  \n3. **Right**: Moves from (3,4) to (3,5).  \n\n*Why This Works:*  \n- These moves follow a logical progression towards the target without diverting unnecessarily.  \n- None of these positions coincide with the obstacle at (5,0).  \n- Total steps taken: 3, matching the Manhattan Distance requirement.\n\n### Option 2: Exploring Alternative Routes  \nWhile thorough exploration ensures completeness, practicality dictates evaluating immediate vicinity. For instance, moving Right early might create isolation issues downstream. Similarly, veering North or West introduces unnecessary detours leading back home.\n\n### Conclusion:  \nOptimizing for both speed and safety directs us to the simplest solution: Proceed directly downward twice, then shift right once. This strategy avoids any potential pitfalls posed by the obstacle and adheres strictly to the least-cost pathway principle.\n\n</think>\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n|summary|\n|--------|\n|optimal Path: [Down, Down, Right]|",

The starting point here is (1,5), which is one unit below the top-right corner since grids start at (0,0). My destination is (5,1), which is near the bottom but not too far left or right\u2014specifically two units above the bottom-left corner if we consider rows increasing downwards? Wait no, actually wait\u2014the problem says (0,0) is the top-left, so moving down increases the row number because it's like how matrices work sometimes where higher indices go downward. So yeah, going from (1,5)\u2014which would be second row last column\u2014to (5,1): fifth row first column.\n\nFirst off, let me visualize the grid:\n\nRow 0: columns 0 to 5.\n...\nRow 5: same as others.\n\nSo positions look something like:\n\n(0,0)   ...     (0,5)\n\n...\n\n(5,0)      ...       (5,5)\n\nBut there\u2019s an obstacle at (5,0). Hmm\u2014that might complicate things when approaching from lower areas towards upper ones?\n\nWait, our movement can only be Up, Down, Left, Right\u2014I think diagonal moves aren't allowed unless specified otherwise, but according to constraints, they're forbidden except for these four directions.\n\nOur task is to find a path with minimal steps probably\u2014but maybe just any valid path isn\u2019t sufficient\u2014it needs to track every position along the way. But perhaps finding the shortest possible path makes sense given typical pathfinding problems.\n\nLet me note all points again:\n\nStart: (1,5).\n\nEnd: (5,1).\n\nObstacles: Only at (5,0); nothing else mentioned.\n\nHmm okay, so my initial thought is whether direct paths interfere with the obstacle(s). Let me see what straight lines could do.\n\nFrom (1,5):\n\nIf trying to move directly toward the end, say, moving down three times until reaching row 4, then... Well, considering ending at (5,1), after getting close enough vertically, adjust horizontally.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to navigate around the obstacle at (5,0). Since (5,0) blocks access into certain parts\u2014if someone wants to reach somewhere beyond its vicinity, especially upwards, he has to detour either through other sides.\n\nLooking more closely, though\u2014in order to get from (1,5) to (5,1), assuming standard movements, the main challenge will likely involve navigating past some blocked cells due to the single obstacle present.\n\nSince the obstacle is located at (5,0), meaning the very edge of the grid\u2014a potential chokepoint. To pass over it, perhaps we should try to stay away from low-row numbers\u2014or alternatively, use alternative routes such as moving sideways earlier rather than passing under it.\n\nAnother thing to check\u2014is the obstacle blocking immediate approaches? For example, coming from north side\u2014we\u2019re currently at (1,5). If we were to head southward initially, does that lead us closer to the obstacle? Or eastwards? Maybe westwards? No, already at maximum x-coordinate (column 5?), so cannot go further east.\n\nWait, hold on! In programming terms, often coordinates increase to the right and down. So yes, (row, col) = y,x respectively. Therefore, (1,5) is indeed the furthest right in row 1.\n\nTherefore, options from (1,5):\nPossible moves: Up, Down, Left, Right.\n\nCan't go Right anymore\u2014as maxed out at column 5. Can't go Left yet, depending on previous direction.\n\nWait, current location is (1,5). From here, available actions include Up, Down, Left, Right.\n\nMoving Right leads nowhere new\u2014all done. Moving Left takes us back to (1,4). Moving Up goes to (0,5). Moving Down brings us to (2,5).\n\nNow, looking ahead, the goal is (5,1). So ideally, want to decrease both row and column distances somehow.\n\nPerhaps exploring different possibilities:\n\nOption 1: Move Up once to (0,5).\nThen proceed East-West? Not sure, seems counterintuitive.\n\nNope, better idea may be to explore moving South early on.\n\nAlternative Option 2: Start by moving Down twice\u2014from (1,5)->(2,5)->(3,5)-> etc., but also thinking about the final target being (5,1). Alternatively, perhaps combining vertical and horizontal moves smartly.\n\nWait, stepping back\u2014forgetting specific algorithms, perhaps using BFS-like logic manually.\n\nEach state consists of current position plus visited nodes to prevent loops.\n\nStarting node: (1,5). Visited set includes itself.\n\nQueue starts with [(1,5)].\n\nProcess queue elements level-wise.\n\nAt Level 0: Current pos=(1,5). Neighbors:\n\nUp \u2192 (0,5). Is this unvisited? Yes. Add to next level.\n\nDown \u2192 (2,5). Unvisited. Add.\n\nLeft\u2192 (1,4). Unvisited. Add.\n\nRight\u2192 invalid.\n\nLevel becomes 1.\n\nNext process those neighbors.\n\nProcessing (0,5):\n\nNeighbors:\n\nUp\u2192 (-1,5)? Invalid.\n\nDown\u2192 (1,5). Already visited.\n\nLeft\u2192 (0,4). New. Add.\n\nRight\u2192 (0,6?) Invalid.\n\nAdd (0,4) to queue.\n\nSimilarly processing (2,5):\n\nNeighbors:\n\nUp\u2192 (1,5). Visited.\n\nDown\u2192 (3,5). New. Add.\n\nLeft\u2192 (2,4). New. Add.\n\nRight\u2192invalid.\n\nAlso adding (3,5) and (2,4).\n\nAnd processing (1,4):\n\nNeighbors:\n\nUp\u2192 (0,4). Which was added via parent (0,5)?\n\nYes, possibly. So depends on implementation details.\n\nIn any case, proceeding similarly.\n\nThis manual expansion quickly gets complex, but perhaps focusing on key points.\n\nGiven that the obstacle is at (5,0), which doesn't block anything immediately reachable from (1,5)'s neighborhood. Because even if we went all the way down to Row=5, Column remains high.\n\nFor instance, suppose we take route:\n\nMove Down thrice: (1,5) -> (2,5) -> (3,5) -> (4,5) -> (5,5). Then turn West multiple times to come to (5,1). That'd require five steps down followed by four steps left\u2014which totals nine steps.\n\nIs that acceptable? Probably, but maybe longer than necessary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps taking a shorter path exists.\n\nWhat happens if instead, we don't go all the way down but make turns elsewhere.\n\nE.g.: Starting at (1,5),\n\nStep 1: Down to (2,5),\nStep 2: Down to (3,5),\nStep 3: Turn Left to (3,4),\nContinue turning left till Step7: (3,1),\nThen continue down to (4,1),(5,1). Total Steps: 9.\n\nSame length as prior method.\n\nHmmm.\n\nOr alternately,\n\nMaybe mix Vertical and Horizontal moves cleverly.\n\nSuppose:\n\nGo down to (2,5),\nthen left to (2,4),\ndown to (3,4),\nleft to (3,3),\nand keep doing this until eventually aligning correctly.\n\nNot necessarily saving steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving diagonally across the grid, but since movement is restricted to orthogonal directions, must stick to U/D/L/R.\n\nAn alternative plan: Instead of going all the way down, perhaps shift focus to moving North-East or similar patterns\u2014not applicable here.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue arises later on when nearing the finish line.\n\nBecause the endpoint is (5,1), which requires having moved quite a bit in the South direction relative to the starting point.\n\nThus, regardless of lateral movements, ultimately needing to traverse several Rows.\n\nI wonder if the presence of the obstacle affects the routing significantly.\n\nThe obstacle is at (5,0). So during traversal, anyone heading towards (5,y) regions must ensure their path avoids entering (5,0).\n\nWhich suggests that arriving at Row 5 shouldn't happen until ensuring that Columns >0.\n\nMeaning, upon reaching Row 5, Column >=1.\n\nHow can we achieve that?\n\nWell, perhaps arrive at Row 5 via Column>=1.\n\nTo accomplish that, perhaps divert slightly upward before descending.\n\nLike, e.g.,\n\nFrom (1,5), go down to (2,5)... continuing down to (4,5), then left to (4,4), then down to (5,4), now safe zone, then left to (5,1).\n\nThat\u2019d be total steps: 8 steps.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nMoves:\n\nD,D,D,L,D,U,U,L \u2014 Wait, let me count them properly.\n\nWait, D\u00d73: (1,5)->(2,5)->(3,5)->(4,5);\n\nL \u00d71 : (4,5)->(4,4);\n\nD \u00d71:(4,4)->(5,4);\n\nU \u00d7something? Wait, no\u2014you can't go up from (5,4) because that's the lowest row.\n\nOops, correction needed.\n\nAfter (5,4), you can't go up anymore because you've reached the bottom. So correct path would be:\n\nFrom (5,4), L \u00d73: (5,4)->(5,3)->(5,2)->(5,1). Thus making overall steps:\n\nInitial D\u00d73 + L\u00d71 + D\u00d71 + L\u00d73 => totaling 8 steps.\n\nTotal steps breakdown:\n\nSteps taken:\n\n1. D \u2013 (2,5)\n\n2. D \u2013 (3,5)\n\n3. D \u2013 (4,5)\n\n4. L \u2013 (4,4)\n\n5. D \u2013 (5,4)\n\n6. L \u2013 (5,3)\n\n7. L \u2013 (5,2)\n\n8. L \u2013 (5,1)\n\nYep, eight steps.\n\nDoes this path hit any obstacles? Obstacle is at (5,0). Our path never touches (5,0), so good.\n\nAlternate Idea: Could we have arrived at (5,1) faster?\n\nPossibly, but hard to imagine. Another option is to snake through the middle area.\n\nSay, from (1,5):\n\nR\u00d71->(1,6) ? No, invalid.\n\nCannot R from (1,5). Max column is 5.\n\nOther possibility: After some downs, switch to left/right.\n\nWait, perhaps alternate between moving down and left.\n\nExample:\n\n(1,5) \u2193 (2,5) \u2191 impossible.\n\nWait, no, stuck.\n\nAlternatively, (1,5) \u2192 (1,4) \u2190 ?\n\nWait, but why bother? It complicates matters.\n\nIt appears that the most straightforward path involves moving mostly down, occasionally veering left to clear the obstacle.\n\nAs per the proposed path, 8 steps seem efficient.\n\nAre there alternatives with fewer steps?\n\nAssuming Manhattan distance from (1,5) to (5,1) is |5\u22121|+|1\u22125|=4+4=8 steps minimum. Hence, achieving exactly 8 steps implies optimality.\n\nIndeed, the suggested path uses precisely 8 steps, hence it's the shortest possible solution.\n\nMoreover, checking for any possible shortcut\u2014like cutting corners\u2014but constrained by the fact that we can't revisit squares nor cross the obstacle.\n\nConclusion: The optimal path comprises moving primarily down, then adjusting left appropriately to bypass the obstacle en route to the desired exit.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nOptimal Path: \\boxed{[D, D, D, L, D, L, L, L]}\n</think>\n\nTo determine the optimal path from (1,5) to (5,1) on a 6x6 grid while avoiding the obstacle at (5,0), we analyzed various movement strategies. \n\nKey considerations included:\n1. Avoiding the obstacle at (5,0).\n2. Using the least number of steps to minimize the path length.\n3. Ensuring each move tracks the position accurately.\n\nBy systematically evaluating possible paths, we found that moving predominantly downward allows us to efficiently navigate around the obstacle. Turning left strategically ensures we avoid the obstacle and reach the destination in the minimum number of steps.\n\n### Summary\n- The optimal path involves moving down three times, then left once, followed by additional left moves to reach the destination safely.\n- This results in a total of 8 steps, which is the shortest possible path given the constraints.\n\n<think>\nAlright, based on the analysis, the optimal path is determined by moving down three times, then left once, and finally left three more times to reach the destination.

So during traversal, anyone heading towards (5,y) regions must ensure their path avoids entering (5,0).\n\nWhich suggests that arriving at Row 5 shouldn't happen until ensuring that Columns >0.\n\nMeaning, upon reaching Row 5, Column >=1.\n\nHow can we achieve that?\n\nWell, perhaps arrive at Row 5 via Column>=1.\n\nTo accomplish that, perhaps divert slightly upward before descending.\n\nLike, e.g.,\n\nFrom (1,5), go down to (2,5)... continuing down to (4,5), then left to (4,4), then down to (5,4), now safe zone, then left to (5,1).\n\nThat\u2019d be total steps: 8 steps.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nMoves:\n\nD,D,D,L,D,U,U,L \u2014 Wait, let me count them properly.\n\nWait, D\u00d73: (1,5)->(2,5)->(3,5)->(4,5);\n\nL \u00d71 : (4,5)->(4,4);\n\nD \u00d71:(4,4)->(5,4);\n\nU \u00d7something? Wait, no\u2014you can't go up from (5,4) because that's the lowest row.\n\nOops, correction needed.\n\nAfter (5,4), you can't go up anymore because you've reached the bottom. So correct path would be:\n\nFrom (5,4), L \u00d73: (5,4)->(5,3)->(5,2)->(5,1). Thus making overall steps:\n\nInitial D\u00d73 + L\u00d71 + D\u00d71 + L\u00d73 => totaling 8 steps.\n\nTotal steps breakdown:\n\nSteps taken:\n\n1. D \u2013 (2,5)\n\n2. D \u2013 (3,5)\n\n3. D \u2013 (4,5)\n\n4. L \u2013 (4,4)\n\n5. D \u2013 (5,4)\n\n6. L \u2013 (5,3)\n\n7. L \u2013 (5,2)\n\n8. L \u2013 (5,1)\n\nYep, eight steps.\n\nDoes this path hit any obstacles? Obstacle is at (5,0). Our path never touches (5,0), so good.\n\nAlternate Idea: Could we have arrived at (5,1) faster?\n\nPossibly, but hard to imagine. Another option is to snake through the middle area.\n\nSay, from (1,5):\n\nR\u00d71->(1,6) ? No, invalid.\n\nCannot R from (1,5). Max column is 5.\n\nOther possibility: After some downs, switch to left/right.\n\nWait, perhaps alternate between moving down and left.\n\nExample:\n\n(1,5) \u2193 (2,5) \u2191 impossible.\n\nWait, no, stuck.\n\nAlternatively, (1,5) \u2192 (1,4) \u2190 ?\n\nWait, but why bother? It complicates matters.\n\nIt appears that the most straightforward path involves moving mostly down, occasionally veering left to clear the obstacle.\n\nAs per the proposed path, 8 steps seem efficient.\n\nAre there alternatives with fewer steps?\n\nAssuming Manhattan distance from (1,5) to (5,1) is |5\u22121|+|1\u22125|=4+4=8 steps minimum. Hence, achieving exactly 8 steps implies optimality.\n\nIndeed, the suggested path uses precisely 8 steps, hence it's the shortest possible solution.\n\nMoreover, checking for any possible shortcut\u2014like cutting corners\u2014but constrained by the fact that we can't revisit squares nor cross the obstacle.\n\nConclusion: The optimal path comprises moving primarily down, then adjusting left appropriately to bypass the obstacle en route to the desired exit.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nOptimal Path: \\boxed{[D, D, D, L, D, L, L, L]}\n</think>\n\nTo determine the optimal path from (1,5) to (5,1) on a 6x6 grid while avoiding the obstacle at (5,0), we analyzed various movement strategies. \n\nKey considerations included:\n1. Avoiding the obstacle at (5,0).\n2. Using the least number of steps to minimize the path length.\n3. Ensuring each move tracks the position accurately.\n\nBy systematically evaluating possible paths, we found that moving predominantly downward allows us to efficiently navigate around the obstacle. Turning left strategically ensures we avoid the obstacle and reach the destination in the minimum number of steps.\n\n### Summary\n- The optimal path involves moving down three times, then left once, followed by additional left moves to reach the destination safely.\n- This results in a total of 8 steps, which is the shortest possible path given the constraints.\n\n<think>\nAlright, based on the analysis, the optimal path is determined by moving down three times, then left once, and finally left three more times to reach the destination.

The starting point here is (2,0), which is somewhere near the left side but not too high or low vertically. My destination is (1,4), which seems like it's more towards the upper middle part of the grid. \n\nFirst off, let me visualize the grid. Since it's 6x6, rows go from 0 to 5 and columns also from 0 to 5. So my start is at (2,0)\u2014that would be third row if we count from zero? Wait no\u2014actually, wait\u2014the first coordinate might represent the row index as per usual matrix notation where (row, column). But sometimes people think differently... Hmm, maybe better just stick with what was given earlier. Oh yeah, according to instructions, (0,0) is top-left corner, meaning higher numbers move downwards for both coordinates?\n\nWait actually, perhaps confusion arises because usually grids can vary how they're indexed. Let me clarify:\n\nIn programming terms, often arrays use (row, column) indices where increasing row moves downward and increasing column moves to the right. So yes, assuming standard Cartesian-like system where moving Right increases x-coordinate and Moving Down increases y-coordinate\u2014but since our grid starts at (0,0) being top-left, then going \"down\" would increase the second number when written as (y,x)? Or does movement affect different axes depending on perspective...\n\nHmm, regardless, probably safest assumption based on problem statement is that movements correspond directly to changing either X or Y directionally\u2014if someone says 'right', their column increments, etc., similar to typical grid systems used in computer graphics.\n\nBut okay, stepping back\u2014I'm supposed to plan a path from (2,0) to (1,4).\n\nNow there\u2019s an obstacle at (5,0). That must mean one square below the starting point has something blocking us\u2014it could block certain paths through lower areas.\n\nSo looking at possible directions from (2,0):\n\nFrom (2,0): Possible initial steps include Up, Down, Left, Right. However, considering boundaries\u2014for example, trying to go beyond the edges isn't allowed unless specified otherwise, though typically such problems assume staying within bounds.\n\nLet me list all possibilities:\n\nAt (2,0):\nPossible Moves:\n- Up \u2192 (1,0)\n- Down \u2192 (3,0)\n- Right \u2192 (2,1)\n- Left \u2192 Not possible, since column=0 cannot decrease further\n\nSimilarly, other points will have constraints accordingly.\n\nGiven that Obstacle exists only at (5,0); so positions adjacent may still pass around them except exactly at those spots.\n\nMy goal is to reach (1,4). Starting at (2,0), so overall change needed is Row decreases by 1, Column increases by 4 units.\n\nIdea: Maybe try to head upwards initially to clear the obstacle at (5,0)?\n\nBecause if I go straight right, passing through some cells, but whether that leads into trouble depends on the presence of obstacles elsewhere\u2014or do I know anything else besides (5,0) is blocked?\n\nLooking again at task description: It mentions only one obstacle at (5,0). So rest should be free space apart from that single spot.\n\nTherefore, theoretically, multiple routes exist, but due to limited information, I'll proceed methodically.\n\nOption 1: Move Up immediately.\nStarting Point: (2,0)\n\nMove Up once\u2192(1,0).\nThen next options: From (1,0), can move Up again to (0,0), or Right to (1,1), or even Back Down to (2,0)... Probably want forward progress toward target.\n\nIf after two Ups reaching (0,0), now from there, potential moves: Up won\u2019t help anymore\u2014as already at top edge\u2014and needs to move Right four times to reach (0,4). Then possibly adjust Rows upward.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: After getting closer to the desired area via ups and rights.\n\nAnother thought process: Perhaps using BFS algorithm conceptually\u2014to explore shortest path ignoring obstructions\u2014which gives minimal steps.\n\nHowever, since manual thinking, let's see alternative approaches.\n\nAlternative Approach Steps:\n\nStart at (2,0). Target is (1,4). Obstacle at (5,0).\n\nOne idea is to navigate above the obstacle. Because obstacle is at (5,0), which is far away horizontally compared to current location.\n\nSince starting at (2,0), heading north (upwards) brings us close to the obstacle region laterally but doesn't interfere yet.\n\nMoving Up twice gets us to (0,0). At (0,0), we\u2019re constrained\u2014we can't go further up, nor left (since stuck at boundary). So from (0,0), most efficient route is to move right until we hit column 4\u2014that'd take 4 steps eastward to (0,4). Then, from (0,4), we\u2019d need to move south once to (1,4). Total steps: 2 Ups + 4 Rights + 1 Down =7 steps.\n\nIs that feasible? Are these intermediate squares unblocked? Yes\u2014they don't mention any obstacles anywhere else aside from (5,0). Therefore, safe passage.\n\nBut hold on\u2014isn't (0,0)'s East neighbor (0,1), which hasn't been mentioned as obstructed. Similarly, proceeding along (0,0)->(0,1)->(0,2)->(0,3)->(0,4) is fine.\n\nOnce reached (0,4), moving South to (1,4) requires checking if (1,4) itself is accessible. No issues noted regarding its status.\n\nThus total path length is manageable.\n\nOther Options:\n\nWhat If instead of moving entirely Up first, mix between Up and Right early on?\n\nFor instance, Start at (2,0). First move Up to (1,0). Next, move Right thrice to (1,3). Then move Down three times to (4,3). Then continue Right to (4,4), then Up to (3,4), then Up to (2,4), then Up to (1,4). This seems longer than previous option requiring many steps.\n\nMoreover, why complicate things unnecessarily? Going straight Up reduces steps significantly.\n\nHence, likely Optimal Path is UU followed by RRRRDDDD? Wait, no\u2014from (0,0) needing to go to (0,4)=four Rs, then D.\n\nTotal steps: 2 Us, 4 Rs, 1 D => seven steps.\n\nCheck if any of these passes over forbidden zones\u2014in particular, check if during the journey, say, (0,y) for y>=0 is ever problematic. As none were mentioned, hence acceptable.\n\nAdditionally, verify that final destination (1,4) is reachable without crossing (5,0). Which shouldn't happen under normal circumstances.\n\nConclusion: The straightforward path of moving Up twice, then Right four times, ending with a Down step yields a valid solution with minimum steps.\n\nPotential Alternative Paths:\n\nSuppose alternatively, from (2,0), move Right several times to bypass the obstacle indirectly.\n\nE.g.: (2,0) -> (2,1) -> ...-> (2,4). Then move Up five times to (from (2,4)) to (-3,4), which obviously goes outside the grid. Hence invalid.\n\nNope, that wouldn't work.\n\nOr, alternately, move Right past the obstacle somehow, but since obstacle is located much farther down, i.e., same column but deeper row-wise, moving Right would keep it distant enough.\n\nPerhaps another strategy: From (2,0), move Right to (2,1), then Down to (3,1), then Right to (3,2), ..., but that complicates matters and takes extra steps.\n\nComparing efficiency, original plan remains shorter.\n\nFinal Plan:\n\nStep-by-step actions:\n\n1. Move Up from (2,0) to (1,0)\n2. Move Up again to (0,0)\n3. Move Right four times sequentially to arrive at (0,4)\n   - Step 3a: (0,0) \u2192 (0,1)\n   - Step 3b: (0,1) \u2192 (0,2)\n   - Step 3c: (0,2) \u2192 (0,3)\n   - Step 3d: (0,3) \u2192 (0,4)\n4. Finally, move Down once to (1,4)\n\nThis totals six movements: Two Ups, Four Rights, One Down.\n\nDouble-checking for validity against known obstacles\u2014all passed safely.\n\nYes, looks solid.\n\n**Summary:**  \nOptimal Path: Up, Up, Right, Right, Right, Right, Down  \n\nWhich translates to the action string: \"UUURRRD\"\n</think>\n\nThe optimal path involves navigating from (2,0) to (1,4) by moving Up twice, then Right four times, and finally Down once. This avoids the obstacle at (5,0) efficiently.\n\n| summary |\n|----------|\n| optimal Path: UP, UP, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN |\n\n<think>\n\nAlright, let's break this down systematically.\n\nWe begin at (2,0) aiming to reach (1,4) on a 6x6 grid with an obstacle at (5,0). Our primary objective is to find the shortest path while avoiding the obstacle.\n\n### Initial Analysis:\n- **Obstacles**: Only present at (5,0), nowhere else affects our path.\n- **Movement Constraints**: Can move Up, Down, Left, or Right, ensuring we stay within grid boundaries.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Direct Route Consideration**: Moving directly towards the target generally minimizes steps.\n2. **Avoidance Strategy**: Prioritize moving North (Up) to circumvent the obstacle at (5,0), especially since it blocks access to lower rows effectively.\n\n### Step-by-Step Path Calculation:\n\n#### Phase 1: Ascend Vertically\n- Starting at (2,0), moving Up twice navigates us to (0,0). This clears the immediate vicinity beneath us, allowing future horizontal expansion without interference.\n\n#### Phase 2: Expand Horizontally\n- From (0,0), moving Right four consecutive steps advances us to (0,4). Each Right increment ensures steady progression towards the target column.\n\n#### Phase 3: Descent Vertically\n- Once at (0,4), a single Down move transitions us seamlessly to (1,4), completing the journey.\n\n### Validation Against Obstacles:\nThroughout this trajectory, every visited node checks out as non-obstructed. Specifically, neither (5,0) nor any other nodes along the path contain obstacles.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy prioritizing vertical ascents to create room for necessary lateral expansions, we achieve an efficient path minimizing unnecessary detours. This results in a smooth transition from the starting point to the target, adhering strictly to movement rules and avoiding conflicts with existing obstacles.\n\n</think>\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe optimal path consists of ascending vertically to allow sufficient horizontal clearance, expanding sideways to cover necessary ground, and concluding descent to meet the endpoint precisely.\n\n|summary|\n|--------|\n|optimal Path: UP, UP, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN|\n\n```plaintext\nActions: U U R R R R D\n```\n\n---",

The starting point here is (2,3), which if I remember correctly, rows go vertically and columns horizontally. So (2,3) would be somewhere towards the bottom left since it's closer to row index 2 but still not too far off. My destination is (5,4), which should be near the bottom edge because both coordinates are high except for maybe one being lower? Wait no\u2014(5,4): x=5, y=4... Hmm, actually wait\u2014the first number might represent the row or the column depending on how we're interpreting it. Oh! In grids like these, sometimes people use different conventions. But according to the problem statement, (0,0) is the top-left corner, meaning higher numbers move downward along the rows. Similarly, moving right increases the second coordinate. \n\nSo let me clarify:\n\nIn programming terms, often arrays start with indices where increasing the first element moves downwards, similar to matrices. For example, matrix[0][0] is top-left, then as i increases, you go down the rows. Columns increase going to the right. So yes, (row, column).\n\nTherefore, our task starts at (2,3)\u2014so third row counting from zero upwards, fourth column over four zeros perhaps?\n\nWait, hold on\u2014if there\u2019s confusion between whether the tuple represents (column, row) vs (row, column)... Let me think again based on standard Cartesian systems used elsewhere. Typically, when given points like (y,x), they refer to vertical and horizontal positions respectively. Since the user mentioned \"top-left\" corresponds to (0,0), probably their system uses (row, column)=coordinates such that movement upward decreases the row value, etc., just like typical image processing.\n\nBut regardless, assuming all movements can only change either row +1/-1 or column +/-1 steps\u2014but direction depends on what counts as Up/down/left/right relative to current position.\n\nGiven that, my goal is to find an optimal path from (2,3) to (5,4) on a 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (5,0). Also note that some other cells may also potentially block paths unless specified otherwise\u2014I assume others aren't blocked beyond (5,0); though better confirm later.\n\nFirstly, plotting possible routes considering the single obstacle at (5,0):\n\nThe target location is (5,4), which seems quite close\u2014it's five units below (since rows count from 0?), but looking back, initial tasks had destinations varying\u2014for instance, earlier examples went into more complex setups.\n\nLet me map out potential directions:\n\nStarting Point S = (2,3)\n\nDestination D = (5,4)\n\nObstacle O = (5,0)\n\nI'll try drawing a mental picture:\n\nRow-wise progression needed: From row 2 to row 5\u2014that requires three steps down (each step adds 1 to the row index). Alternatively, could stay within same row via lateral movements until reaching desired spot.\n\nColumn-wise progress: Need to go from column 3 to column 4\u2014a simple rightward step once reached correct row(s).\n\nHowever, the presence of an obstacle at (5,0) complicates things. Obstacles cannot be stepped upon\u2014they must be avoided entirely.\n\nLooking directly above the obstacle, say around its vicinity, but since the obstacle itself is at (5,0), which is fifth row, very low column. Our destination is much further east\u2014at (5,4). Therefore, direct south-east approach isn\u2019t feasible due to needing to pass through forbidden area.\n\nAlternative approaches include detouring northwards away from the obstacle\u2014or alternatively, finding another route altogether.\n\nSince the obstacle blocks certain pathways, especially those leading straight down past row 5, perhaps navigating west or east prior to heading toward the destination becomes necessary.\n\nAlternatively, consider moving sideways across nearby rows to bypass the obstruction.\n\nAnother thought\u2014is the obstacle located exactly two rows above the destination? No\u2014in fact, the obstacle is at (5,0), whereas the destination is at (5,4). They share the same row, but separated by several columns. Thus, stepping onto row 5 will require careful navigation around the obstacle.\n\nPerhaps instead of trying to head straight down, take a slightly longer path that goes around the obstacle.\n\nPossible strategies:\n\nOption 1: Move Right twice initially, then Down thrice, then Left appropriately...\n\nNo, wait\u2014from (2,3), moving right takes us to (2,4), then (2,5)? Or does 'right' mean incrementing the column? Yes, typically, right increments the column part.\n\nFrom (2,3):\nMoving right \u2192 (2,4),\nAgain right\u2192 (2,5),\n\nThen proceed down to reach (5,5)?\n\nHmm, but after getting to (2,5), moving down multiple times gets us to (5,5). Then, finally, moving left once brings us to (5,4). That works!\n\nIs that allowed? Let's see:\n\nStarts at (2,3).\nActions: R, R.\nNow at (2,5).\nNext actions: D, D, D \u2014 arriving at (5,5).\nFinally L arrives at (5,4).\n\nThat avoids passing through (5,0) completely\u2014as none of these intermediate nodes conflict with the obstacle.\n\nWhat else needs checking\u2014are any of the moved-through cells occupied besides the obstacle? Well, per constraints, only specific obstacle exists at (5,0). Other cells seem free.\n\nThus, total steps taken: 2 rights followed by 3 downs plus 1 left\u2014which totals six steps.\n\nAlternatively, check alternative paths:\n\nSuppose someone tries to go down early:\n\nAt (2,3)->D->(3,3)->D->(4,3)->D->(5,3). At (5,3), now attempting to move right to (5,4). However, (5,0) doesn't interfere here\u2014all safe. So why was thinking about Option 1 even considered? Because the obstacle is at (5,0), which is separate from (5,3). Hence, taking that path wouldn't hit anything.\n\nHence, another valid option is simply moving down thrice, then right once.\n\nWhich gives Steps: D,D,D,R\n\nThis results in fewer steps than previous idea\u2014only four steps versus seven previously.\n\nWait, original plan took 7 steps, new plan takes 4 steps. Which makes sense\u2014heh, obviously prefer shorter path length.\n\nWhy didn't I realize that immediately? Maybe oversighted possibilities.\n\nYes, indeed, moving down thrice reaches (5,3), then moving right once lands precisely at (5,4). This method skips unnecessary lateral movements and thus provides a quicker solution.\n\nMoreover, neither of these paths involves crossing the obstacle zone\u2014we\u2019re safely moving either diagonally or sidestepping around it.\n\nAdditionally, verifying that during traversal, do any of the intermediary cells coincide with the obstacle? Starting at (2,3), moving down leads to (3,3),(4,3),(5,3). None conflicting with (5,0). Moving right afterward to (5,4) is fine.\n\nSimilarly, using the alternate path: Start at (2,3), move right-right-right-down-down-down\u2014wait, hangon, that would involve moving East/East/East, ending up at (2,6?) but nvm, size is 6x6, indexes likely run till 5 inclusive. So maximum column is 5.\n\nAh, okay, so (2,3)+R+R+R=(2,6) exceeds max col 5. Oops mistake.\n\nOops, correction: Grid is 6x6, implying indices range from 0\u20135 for both rows and cols. So (2,3)'s next right is (2,4), then (2,5). Next attempt to move right would exceed bounds, hence invalid.\n\nTherefore, the first strategy involving moving right twice is limited\u2014you can't go beyond column 5. So revisiting options.\n\nIf I'm at (2,3), moving right twice ends at (2,5). Then proceeding down thrice to (5,5), then left once to (5,4). Total steps: RRDDD L => 2+3+1=6 steps.\n\nAlternatively, moving down thrice to (5,3), then right once to (5,4). That's DD D R \u2013 4 steps.\n\nBoth methods work, but latter is faster.\n\nAre there any other ways? Perhaps combining lateral movements among various rows.\n\nFor example, moving right once, then down thrice, then left accordingly\u2026 Not sure if that helps.\n\nE.g.: (2,3) -> R (to 2,4);\nthen DDD (reaches 5,4). Wait, really? If started at (2,3), moving right once puts you at (2,4). Then moving down thrice: Each D increases row by 1, so (3,4), (4,4), (5,4). Done in four steps: R, D, D, D. Perfect.\n\nOh wow, that's cleverer yet simpler. Why hadn't I thought of that sooner?\n\nBecause from (2,3), moving right once allows access to adjacent column, thereby enabling straightforward descent to (5,4) without having to navigate around the obstacle.\n\nIndeed, that's efficient\u2014one extra step compared to the other method, but overall less steps.\n\nSo yeah, the minimal path consists of moving right once, then down thrice.\n\nTotal steps: Four.\n\nCheck if any of these steps cross the obstacle site (5,0). Obviously, (5,0) has nothing to do with (5,4), nor affects the path described.\n\nAlso ensure that all traversed cells are unblocked. As long as (5,0) is the only obstacle, rest are clear.\n\nConclusion: Optimal path is R, D, D, D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n| summary |\n|--------|\n| optimal Path: ['down', 'down', 'down', 'right']  \n\n</think>\n\nTo determine the optimal path from (2,3) to (5,4) on a 6x6 grid while avoiding the obstacle at (5,0), we analyzed several potential routes. After evaluating different strategies, the most efficient path involved moving right once to align with the same column as the destination, followed by descending directly to the target.\n\n### Summary\n\nOptimal Path: ['down', 'down', 'down', 'right']\n\n---\n\n<think>\n\nAlright, let's break this down step-by-step to understand how we arrived at the optimal path.\n\n1. **Understanding the Grid**: We have a 6x6 grid where each cell is identified by its row and column indices ranging from 0 to 5. The starting point is (2,3), and the destination is (5,4). The obstacle is located at (5,0), which we must avoid.\n\n2. **Initial Considerations**: Directly moving down from (2,3) to (5,3) seemed promising because it keeps us aligned with the same column throughout the journey. Once at (5,3), moving right once would bring us directly to the destination (5,4).\n\n3. **Avoiding the Obstacle**: The obstacle is at (5,0), which is significantly west of our intended path. By staying within the same column (column 3) until we reach row 5, we effectively bypass the obstacle region.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Movement**:\n   - Start at (2,3).\n   - Move down three times consecutively to traverse from row 2 to row 5, landing at (5,3).\n   - Finally, move right once to reach (5,4).\n\n5. **Efficiency Check**: This path ensures we minimize the number of steps by reducing redundant movements. Instead of wandering unnecessarily, we follow a direct route that avoids the obstacle efficiently.\n\nBy following this structured analysis, we determined that the shortest and safest path is achieved by descending directly to the target column and then moving right once.\n</think>\n\n|summary|\n|--------|\n| optimal Path: ['down', 'down', 'down', 'right']",

The starting point here is (5,5), which is actually quite far away since grids usually start counting from 0. So if it's a 6x6 grid, then both rows and columns go from 0 to 5. That makes sense because sometimes programming uses zero-based indexing for arrays or coordinates.\n\nThe goal is to reach (2,2), which should be somewhere closer towards the center but not too close considering we're moving within six steps maximum probably? Wait no\u2014actually, movement isn't limited except by obstacles. But let me think more clearly.\n\nFirstly, there\u2019s an obstacle at (5,0). Hmm, okay, so when trying to move around, especially near higher-numbered cells like those with high x-values, I might hit some issues. Let me visualize the grid:\n\nImagine a matrix where each cell can either be free (-1 maybe?) or blocked (like having an obstacle). In our case, only one cell has an obstacle\u2014at (5,0).\n\nSo my task starts at (5,5)\u2014the bottom-right corner\u2014and needs to end at (2,2), which would typically require going left twice and up three times\u2014or something similar\u2014but given possible obstructions due to other paths being blocked?\n\nWait, wait\u2014the problem says \"obstacles\" plural as well. Oh! No\u2014it just mentions one obstacle at (5,0)? Or was that part of another example earlier? Looking back...\n\nNo, looking again, yes\u2014in all these tasks, they mention taking into account certain specific points as obstacles. For instance, first example had an obstacle at (2,1); second at (0,4); third now also seems to refer specifically to (5,0). So perhaps multiple such obstacles exist elsewhere besides that single one mentioned? Or does every 'task' involve exactly one specified obstacle location?\n\nIn this particular current problem statement, under the constraints section, it specifies that the user must take care of an obstacle at (5,0). So yeah, only that one spot is blocked.\n\nTherefore, thinking through how to navigate from (5,5) to (2,2):\n\nLet me sketch mentally what directions could lead us toward the target.\n\nStarting at (5,5): Possible moves initially include Up, Left, Right... Well, Right wouldn\u2019t make much sense unless needed later\u2014if anything, moving further away vertically may help reduce horizontal spread.\n\nBut stepping back, directionally, getting from (5,5) to (2,2) requires decreasing both X and Y values over time. Since movements allowed are four-directional, including diagonals aren't permitted\u2014they\u2019re restricted to orthogonal moves.\n\nHmm, so plan-wise, likely will involve moving upwards primarily until reaching y=2, adjusting along the way.\n\nNow, key thing is to ensure that none of the intermediate positions land on (5,0), though in reality, (5,0) is pretty low on the grid compared to (5,5). So depending on whether the path goes directly upward or takes detours via sides, collision risk varies.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using BFS algorithmic approach would give shortest path automatically, accounting for obstacles. However, since I'm doing manual analysis, let me try mapping potential routes.\n\nOption 1: Move straight up\n\nFrom (5,5):\nMove Up \u2192 (4,5),\nAgain Up \u2192 (3,5),\nThen Up\u2192(2,5).\nAt (2,5), next desired action is to shift left thrice.\nEach Left brings us to lower X-coordinate:\nAfter First Left: (2,4);\nSecond Left: (2,3);\nThird Left: (2,2). \n\nThat works perfectly fine\u2014isn't passing through (5,0)?\n\nYes, because during ascent, we were moving from Row 5 to Rows 4,3,2\u2014all different than 5, hence safe regarding the obstacle at (5,0).
