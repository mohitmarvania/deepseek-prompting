But according to the problem statement, (0,0) is the top-left corner, meaning if we move \"down\", our y-coordinate would increase?

Since it's a 6x6 grid, rows go from 0 to 5 vertically, and columns also from 0 to 5 horizontally.

The starting point here is (1,4), which if I remember correctly, rows go vertically and columns horizontally. So (1,4) would be one unit below the top-left corner since it's zero-indexed? Wait no, actually wait\u2014(0,0) is the top-left, meaning higher numbers for both increase as we move down-right. Hmm maybe not\u2014I should clarify how coordinates work here because getting confused might lead me astray.\n\nWait, let me think again. In grids like these, sometimes people use matrix notation where (row, column)\u2014so moving \"down\" increases the row number, but some systems consider movement differently based on screen orientation or something else. But according to the problem statement, (0,0) is the top-left, so probably increasing y goes downward when looking at the grid visually. Or perhaps x-axis moves along the bottom... No, more likely, standard Cartesian-like system with origin at top-left, positive x going right, positive y going down?\n\nSo given that, our start is (1,4): first row, fifth column assuming counting starts at 0. And end goal is (3,5): fourth row, sixth column. Obstacle is at (5,0).\n\nFirst thing\u2019s first\u2014the map itself isn't provided except through tasks. From previous examples:\n\nIn task two, there was an obstacle at (0,4); someone went from (5,4) to (2,4) using only upwards movements\u2014it makes sense they had to stay clear of whatever blocked their path elsewhere.\n\nBut now, my current scenario has different points. Let me visualize the grid mentally.\n\nLet me sketch what I know:\n\nGrid size: 6x6 cells, indices from (0,0) to (5,5).\nStarts at S=(1,4), ends at T=(3,5).\nObstacle O is at (5,0).\n\nI can\u2019t pass through O, nor anywhere else marked as having an obstacle\u2014but other than O, all others seem free unless specified otherwise.\n\nSince the user hasn't mentioned any other obstacles besides (5,0), I assume everything else is open space.\n\nNow, possible paths could involve various routes around the obstacle. Since the obstacle is located far away\u2014at the lower left corner\u2014isn't blocking much near the start or finish areas.\n\nHmm, okay, so thinking about allowed directions: Up, Down, Left, Right\u2014all four cardinal directions.\n\nStarting at (1,4):\n\nFrom (1,4):\nPossible initial steps include moving right towards (1,5), then further right until reach edge\u2014or backtracking left into (1,3)... Alternatively, moving up to (0,4), but considering whether that area is obstructed\u2014if nothing blocks between (0,4) and (1,4), why take extra risk? Maybe safer just to explore sideways initially.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is BFS (Breadth First Search) algorithm commonly used for shortest pathfinding in unweighted graphs\u2014which applies well here since every action costs same amount.\n\nGiven that, perhaps modeling positions reachable via BFS will help find minimal-length path.\n\nHowever, doing manual BFS may be tedious due to limited knowledge of exact grid state beyond single obstacle. But knowing that most parts are open allows certain assumptions.\n\nLooking at target location (3,5): It's three units down from start's Y-coordinate (since X=3 vs X=1?), wait hold on\u2014that depends on coordinate interpretation.\n\nIf (y,x) corresponds to (row,column), then (start)=(1,4)=Row 1, Column 4.\nTarget = (3,5)= Row 3, Column 5.\n\nTo get from (1,4)->(3,5), direction-wise needs to cover +2 Rows and +1 Column overall.\n\nPotential options:\n\nOption 1: Move down twice, then right once. That'd require checking if those intermediate squares are accessible.\n\nPositions after Step 1: Moving down from (1,4) \u2192 (2,4)\n\nStep 2: Again down\u2192 (3,4)\n\nThen right\u2192 (3,5). Is anything blocking these spots?\n\nCheck if any square among them is occupied by obstacle(s)? Only known obstacle is at (5,0). So none interfere directly.\n\nThus, seems feasible\u2014a straight line downwards followed by eastward.\n\nIs that correct though? Because depending on actual layout, even if direct path doesn't hit obstacle, does it cross over somewhere else unintentionally? Without seeing entire grid, hard to say, but per constraints, only specific obstacle exists.\n\nAnother option: Could also try moving East first instead of South.\n\nAt Start Point (1,4):\n\nMove right to (1,5), check if that's safe\u2014as long as (1,5) is empty, proceed.\n\nFrom (1,5), next choices: right leads off-grid (as max col index is 5?) Wait, Grid is 6x6, indexes run from 0\u20135 inclusive. Thus, maximum column is 5, hence cannot move right anymore.\n\nTherefore, alternative route from (1,5) must either turn south or north.\n\nMoving North brings us back to (1,4), which loops\u2014we don't want cycles.\n\nHence, better idea is to head South from (1,4) toward (2,4), etc., rather than trying to snake through.\n\nSimilarly, attempting to move West from (1,4) takes us to (1,3), but potentially leaving ourselves isolated later on.\n\nPerhaps exploring multiple avenues systematically helps prevent missing shorter paths.\n\nAlternative plan: Try expanding nodes level-by-level.\n\nLevel 0: Starting node (1,4).\n\nNeighbors available: All adjacent non-obstructed cells.\n\nWhich ones are neighbors?\nNorth: (0,4) \u2013 Unblocked.\nSouth: (2,4) \u2013 Unblocked.\nEast: (1,5) \u2013 Unblocked.\nWest: (1,3) \u2013 Unblocked.\n\nAll four directions are valid.\n\nProceeding Level 1: Each neighbor becomes part of Level 1.\n\nFor example,\n\nFrom (1,4)'s children:\n\nA. (0,4)\n   Neighbors: Can go South, East, West\n\nBecause above (0,4), moving North would exceed bounds.\n\nSame logic continues...\n\nThis process quickly gets complex manually, especially mapping all possibilities.\n\nInstead, focusing on the fact that the obstacle is quite distant\u2014from (5,0), whereas the desired path requires navigating mainly middle sections.\n\nConsidering that, perhaps the straightforward path is indeed viable.\n\nGoing down twice, then right once.\n\nThat gives Steps: D, D, R.\n\nResultant path length is 3 actions.\n\nChecking validity:\n\nEach step:\n\nD: (1,4) -> (2,4) \u2014 Clear.\n\nSecond D: (2,4) -> (3,4) \u2014 Also clear.\n\nR: (3,4) -> (3,5) \u2014 Clear.\n\nNo obstructions encountered during traversal.\n\nAdditionally, such a path uses minimum steps necessary, thus being efficient.\n\nAre there alternatives requiring fewer steps? Probably not, since Manhattan distance suggests needing min(\u0394Y+ \u0394X) steps\u2014in this case, delta-Y is 2, Delta-X is 1 \u21d2 total 3 steps needed regardless of order.\n\nAny deviation would result in longer path lengths.\n\nMoreover, since the obstacle is too far to affect nearby decisions, the safest bet is taking the quickest path.\n\nConclusion: Optimal path consists of moving down twice, then right once.\n</think>\n\nThe optimal path involves moving down twice and then right once to navigate from the starting point to the destination efficiently without encountering the obstacle.\n\n| summary |\n|----------|\n| optimal Path: [Down, Down, Right] |\n\n<think>\n\nAlright, let's break this down methodically.\n\n**Problem Overview:**  \nWe're tasked with finding the shortest path from (1,4) to (3,5) on a 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (5,0). Movement is restricted to Up, Down, Left, Right.\n\n**Understanding Coordinates:**  \nAssuming (0,0) is Top-Left, incrementing 'y' moves Downwards, and incrementing 'x' moves Rightwards.\n\n**Key Points:**  \n- Start: (1,4) => Second row, Fifth column.\n- End: (3,5) => Fourth row, Sixth column.\n- Obstacle: At (5,0) => Bottom-Left corner.\n\n**Analyzing Possible Paths:**  \nThere are several potential pathways, but efficiency is key. We'll evaluate feasibility and obstruction risks.\n\n### Option 1: Direct Downward and Rightward Path  \nSteps:  \n1. **Down**: Moves from (1,4) to (2,4).  \n2. **Down**: Moves from (2,4) to (3,4).  \n3. **Right**: Moves from (3,4) to (3,5).  \n\n*Why This Works:*  \n- These moves follow a logical progression towards the target without diverting unnecessarily.  \n- None of these positions coincide with the obstacle at (5,0).  \n- Total steps taken: 3, matching the Manhattan Distance requirement.\n\n### Option 2: Exploring Alternative Routes  \nWhile thorough exploration ensures completeness, practicality dictates evaluating immediate vicinity. For instance, moving Right early might create isolation issues downstream. Similarly, veering North or West introduces unnecessary detours leading back home.\n\n### Conclusion:  \nOptimizing for both speed and safety directs us to the simplest solution: Proceed directly downward twice, then shift right once. This strategy avoids any potential pitfalls posed by the obstacle and adheres strictly to the least-cost pathway principle.\n\n</think>\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n|summary|\n|--------|\n|optimal Path: [Down, Down, Right]|",

The starting point here is (1,5), which is one unit below the top-right corner since grids start at (0,0). My destination is (5,1), which is near the bottom but not too far left or right\u2014specifically two units above the bottom-left corner if we consider rows increasing downwards? Wait no, actually wait\u2014the problem says (0,0) is the top-left, so moving down increases the row number because it's like how matrices work sometimes where higher indices go downward. So yeah, going from (1,5)\u2014which would be second row last column\u2014to (5,1): fifth row first column.\n\nFirst off, let me visualize the grid:\n\nRow 0: columns 0 to 5.\n...\nRow 5: same as others.\n\nSo positions look something like:\n\n(0,0)   ...     (0,5)\n\n...\n\n(5,0)      ...       (5,5)\n\nBut there\u2019s an obstacle at (5,0). Hmm\u2014that might complicate things when approaching from lower areas towards upper ones?\n\nWait, our movement can only be Up, Down, Left, Right\u2014I think diagonal moves aren't allowed unless specified otherwise, but according to constraints, they're forbidden except for these four directions.\n\nOur task is to find a path with minimal steps probably\u2014but maybe just any valid path isn\u2019t sufficient\u2014it needs to track every position along the way. But perhaps finding the shortest possible path makes sense given typical pathfinding problems.\n\nLet me note all points again:\n\nStart: (1,5).\n\nEnd: (5,1).\n\nObstacles: Only at (5,0); nothing else mentioned.\n\nHmm okay, so my initial thought is whether direct paths interfere with the obstacle(s). Let me see what straight lines could do.\n\nFrom (1,5):\n\nIf trying to move directly toward the end, say, moving down three times until reaching row 4, then... Well, considering ending at (5,1), after getting close enough vertically, adjust horizontally.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to navigate around the obstacle at (5,0). Since (5,0) blocks access into certain parts\u2014if someone wants to reach somewhere beyond its vicinity, especially upwards, he has to detour either through other sides.\n\nLooking more closely, though\u2014in order to get from (1,5) to (5,1), assuming standard movements, the main challenge will likely involve navigating past some blocked cells due to the single obstacle present.\n\nSince the obstacle is located at (5,0), meaning the very edge of the grid\u2014a potential chokepoint. To pass over it, perhaps we should try to stay away from low-row numbers\u2014or alternatively, use alternative routes such as moving sideways earlier rather than passing under it.\n\nAnother thing to check\u2014is the obstacle blocking immediate approaches? For example, coming from north side\u2014we\u2019re currently at (1,5). If we were to head southward initially, does that lead us closer to the obstacle? Or eastwards? Maybe westwards? No, already at maximum x-coordinate (column 5?), so cannot go further east.\n\nWait, hold on! In programming terms, often coordinates increase to the right and down. So yes, (row, col) = y,x respectively. Therefore, (1,5) is indeed the furthest right in row 1.\n\nTherefore, options from (1,5):\nPossible moves: Up, Down, Left, Right.\n\nCan't go Right anymore\u2014as maxed out at column 5. Can't go Left yet, depending on previous direction.\n\nWait, current location is (1,5). From here, available actions include Up, Down, Left, Right.\n\nMoving Right leads nowhere new\u2014all done. Moving Left takes us back to (1,4). Moving Up goes to (0,5). Moving Down brings us to (2,5).\n\nNow, looking ahead, the goal is (5,1). So ideally, want to decrease both row and column distances somehow.\n\nPerhaps exploring different possibilities:\n\nOption 1: Move Up once to (0,5).\nThen proceed East-West? Not sure, seems counterintuitive.\n\nNope, better idea may be to explore moving South early on.\n\nAlternative Option 2: Start by moving Down twice\u2014from (1,5)->(2,5)->(3,5)-> etc., but also thinking about the final target being (5,1). Alternatively, perhaps combining vertical and horizontal moves smartly.\n\nWait, stepping back\u2014forgetting specific algorithms, perhaps using BFS-like logic manually.\n\nEach state consists of current position plus visited nodes to prevent loops.\n\nStarting node: (1,5). Visited set includes itself.\n\nQueue starts with [(1,5)].\n\nProcess queue elements level-wise.\n\nAt Level 0: Current pos=(1,5). Neighbors:\n\nUp \u2192 (0,5). Is this unvisited? Yes. Add to next level.\n\nDown \u2192 (2,5). Unvisited. Add.\n\nLeft\u2192 (1,4). Unvisited. Add.\n\nRight\u2192 invalid.\n\nLevel becomes 1.\n\nNext process those neighbors.\n\nProcessing (0,5):\n\nNeighbors:\n\nUp\u2192 (-1,5)? Invalid.\n\nDown\u2192 (1,5). Already visited.\n\nLeft\u2192 (0,4). New. Add.\n\nRight\u2192 (0,6?) Invalid.\n\nAdd (0,4) to queue.\n\nSimilarly processing (2,5):\n\nNeighbors:\n\nUp\u2192 (1,5). Visited.\n\nDown\u2192 (3,5). New. Add.\n\nLeft\u2192 (2,4). New. Add.\n\nRight\u2192invalid.\n\nAlso adding (3,5) and (2,4).\n\nAnd processing (1,4):\n\nNeighbors:\n\nUp\u2192 (0,4). Which was added via parent (0,5)?\n\nYes, possibly. So depends on implementation details.\n\nIn any case, proceeding similarly.\n\nThis manual expansion quickly gets complex, but perhaps focusing on key points.\n\nGiven that the obstacle is at (5,0), which doesn't block anything immediately reachable from (1,5)'s neighborhood. Because even if we went all the way down to Row=5, Column remains high.\n\nFor instance, suppose we take route:\n\nMove Down thrice: (1,5) -> (2,5) -> (3,5) -> (4,5) -> (5,5). Then turn West multiple times to come to (5,1). That'd require five steps down followed by four steps left\u2014which totals nine steps.\n\nIs that acceptable? Probably, but maybe longer than necessary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps taking a shorter path exists.\n\nWhat happens if instead, we don't go all the way down but make turns elsewhere.\n\nE.g.: Starting at (1,5),\n\nStep 1: Down to (2,5),\nStep 2: Down to (3,5),\nStep 3: Turn Left to (3,4),\nContinue turning left till Step7: (3,1),\nThen continue down to (4,1),(5,1). Total Steps: 9.\n\nSame length as prior method.\n\nHmmm.\n\nOr alternately,\n\nMaybe mix Vertical and Horizontal moves cleverly.\n\nSuppose:\n\nGo down to (2,5),\nthen left to (2,4),\ndown to (3,4),\nleft to (3,3),\nand keep doing this until eventually aligning correctly.\n\nNot necessarily saving steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving diagonally across the grid, but since movement is restricted to orthogonal directions, must stick to U/D/L/R.\n\nAn alternative plan: Instead of going all the way down, perhaps shift focus to moving North-East or similar patterns\u2014not applicable here.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue arises later on when nearing the finish line.\n\nBecause the endpoint is (5,1), which requires having moved quite a bit in the South direction relative to the starting point.\n\nThus, regardless of lateral movements, ultimately needing to traverse several Rows.\n\nI wonder if the presence of the obstacle affects the routing significantly.\n\nThe obstacle is at (5,0). So during traversal, anyone heading towards (5,y) regions must ensure their path avoids entering (5,0).\n\nWhich suggests that arriving at Row 5 shouldn't happen until ensuring that Columns >0.\n\nMeaning, upon reaching Row 5, Column >=1.\n\nHow can we achieve that?\n\nWell, perhaps arrive at Row 5 via Column>=1.\n\nTo accomplish that, perhaps divert slightly upward before descending.\n\nLike, e.g.,\n\nFrom (1,5), go down to (2,5)... continuing down to (4,5), then left to (4,4), then down to (5,4), now safe zone, then left to (5,1).\n\nThat\u2019d be total steps: 8 steps.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nMoves:\n\nD,D,D,L,D,U,U,L \u2014 Wait, let me count them properly.\n\nWait, D\u00d73: (1,5)->(2,5)->(3,5)->(4,5);\n\nL \u00d71 : (4,5)->(4,4);\n\nD \u00d71:(4,4)->(5,4);\n\nU \u00d7something? Wait, no\u2014you can't go up from (5,4) because that's the lowest row.\n\nOops, correction needed.\n\nAfter (5,4), you can't go up anymore because you've reached the bottom. So correct path would be:\n\nFrom (5,4), L \u00d73: (5,4)->(5,3)->(5,2)->(5,1). Thus making overall steps:\n\nInitial D\u00d73 + L\u00d71 + D\u00d71 + L\u00d73 => totaling 8 steps.\n\nTotal steps breakdown:\n\nSteps taken:\n\n1. D \u2013 (2,5)\n\n2. D \u2013 (3,5)\n\n3. D \u2013 (4,5)\n\n4. L \u2013 (4,4)\n\n5. D \u2013 (5,4)\n\n6. L \u2013 (5,3)\n\n7. L \u2013 (5,2)\n\n8. L \u2013 (5,1)\n\nYep, eight steps.\n\nDoes this path hit any obstacles? Obstacle is at (5,0). Our path never touches (5,0), so good.\n\nAlternate Idea: Could we have arrived at (5,1) faster?\n\nPossibly, but hard to imagine. Another option is to snake through the middle area.\n\nSay, from (1,5):\n\nR\u00d71->(1,6) ? No, invalid.\n\nCannot R from (1,5). Max column is 5.\n\nOther possibility: After some downs, switch to left/right.\n\nWait, perhaps alternate between moving down and left.\n\nExample:\n\n(1,5) \u2193 (2,5) \u2191 impossible.\n\nWait, no, stuck.\n\nAlternatively, (1,5) \u2192 (1,4) \u2190 ?\n\nWait, but why bother? It complicates matters.\n\nIt appears that the most straightforward path involves moving mostly down, occasionally veering left to clear the obstacle.\n\nAs per the proposed path, 8 steps seem efficient.\n\nAre there alternatives with fewer steps?\n\nAssuming Manhattan distance from (1,5) to (5,1) is |5\u22121|+|1\u22125|=4+4=8 steps minimum. Hence, achieving exactly 8 steps implies optimality.\n\nIndeed, the suggested path uses precisely 8 steps, hence it's the shortest possible solution.\n\nMoreover, checking for any possible shortcut\u2014like cutting corners\u2014but constrained by the fact that we can't revisit squares nor cross the obstacle.\n\nConclusion: The optimal path comprises moving primarily down, then adjusting left appropriately to bypass the obstacle en route to the desired exit.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nOptimal Path: \\boxed{[D, D, D, L, D, L, L, L]}\n</think>\n\nTo determine the optimal path from (1,5) to (5,1) on a 6x6 grid while avoiding the obstacle at (5,0), we analyzed various movement strategies. \n\nKey considerations included:\n1. Avoiding the obstacle at (5,0).\n2. Using the least number of steps to minimize the path length.\n3. Ensuring each move tracks the position accurately.\n\nBy systematically evaluating possible paths, we found that moving predominantly downward allows us to efficiently navigate around the obstacle. Turning left strategically ensures we avoid the obstacle and reach the destination in the minimum number of steps.\n\n### Summary\n- The optimal path involves moving down three times, then left once, followed by additional left moves to reach the destination safely.\n- This results in a total of 8 steps, which is the shortest possible path given the constraints.\n\n<think>\nAlright, based on the analysis, the optimal path is determined by moving down three times, then left once, and finally left three more times to reach the destination.

So during traversal, anyone heading towards (5,y) regions must ensure their path avoids entering (5,0).\n\nWhich suggests that arriving at Row 5 shouldn't happen until ensuring that Columns >0.\n\nMeaning, upon reaching Row 5, Column >=1.\n\nHow can we achieve that?\n\nWell, perhaps arrive at Row 5 via Column>=1.\n\nTo accomplish that, perhaps divert slightly upward before descending.\n\nLike, e.g.,\n\nFrom (1,5), go down to (2,5)... continuing down to (4,5), then left to (4,4), then down to (5,4), now safe zone, then left to (5,1).\n\nThat\u2019d be total steps: 8 steps.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nMoves:\n\nD,D,D,L,D,U,U,L \u2014 Wait, let me count them properly.\n\nWait, D\u00d73: (1,5)->(2,5)->(3,5)->(4,5);\n\nL \u00d71 : (4,5)->(4,4);\n\nD \u00d71:(4,4)->(5,4);\n\nU \u00d7something? Wait, no\u2014you can't go up from (5,4) because that's the lowest row.\n\nOops, correction needed.\n\nAfter (5,4), you can't go up anymore because you've reached the bottom. So correct path would be:\n\nFrom (5,4), L \u00d73: (5,4)->(5,3)->(5,2)->(5,1). Thus making overall steps:\n\nInitial D\u00d73 + L\u00d71 + D\u00d71 + L\u00d73 => totaling 8 steps.\n\nTotal steps breakdown:\n\nSteps taken:\n\n1. D \u2013 (2,5)\n\n2. D \u2013 (3,5)\n\n3. D \u2013 (4,5)\n\n4. L \u2013 (4,4)\n\n5. D \u2013 (5,4)\n\n6. L \u2013 (5,3)\n\n7. L \u2013 (5,2)\n\n8. L \u2013 (5,1)\n\nYep, eight steps.\n\nDoes this path hit any obstacles? Obstacle is at (5,0). Our path never touches (5,0), so good.\n\nAlternate Idea: Could we have arrived at (5,1) faster?\n\nPossibly, but hard to imagine. Another option is to snake through the middle area.\n\nSay, from (1,5):\n\nR\u00d71->(1,6) ? No, invalid.\n\nCannot R from (1,5). Max column is 5.\n\nOther possibility: After some downs, switch to left/right.\n\nWait, perhaps alternate between moving down and left.\n\nExample:\n\n(1,5) \u2193 (2,5) \u2191 impossible.\n\nWait, no, stuck.\n\nAlternatively, (1,5) \u2192 (1,4) \u2190 ?\n\nWait, but why bother? It complicates matters.\n\nIt appears that the most straightforward path involves moving mostly down, occasionally veering left to clear the obstacle.\n\nAs per the proposed path, 8 steps seem efficient.\n\nAre there alternatives with fewer steps?\n\nAssuming Manhattan distance from (1,5) to (5,1) is |5\u22121|+|1\u22125|=4+4=8 steps minimum. Hence, achieving exactly 8 steps implies optimality.\n\nIndeed, the suggested path uses precisely 8 steps, hence it's the shortest possible solution.\n\nMoreover, checking for any possible shortcut\u2014like cutting corners\u2014but constrained by the fact that we can't revisit squares nor cross the obstacle.\n\nConclusion: The optimal path comprises moving primarily down, then adjusting left appropriately to bypass the obstacle en route to the desired exit.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nOptimal Path: \\boxed{[D, D, D, L, D, L, L, L]}\n</think>\n\nTo determine the optimal path from (1,5) to (5,1) on a 6x6 grid while avoiding the obstacle at (5,0), we analyzed various movement strategies. \n\nKey considerations included:\n1. Avoiding the obstacle at (5,0).\n2. Using the least number of steps to minimize the path length.\n3. Ensuring each move tracks the position accurately.\n\nBy systematically evaluating possible paths, we found that moving predominantly downward allows us to efficiently navigate around the obstacle. Turning left strategically ensures we avoid the obstacle and reach the destination in the minimum number of steps.\n\n### Summary\n- The optimal path involves moving down three times, then left once, followed by additional left moves to reach the destination safely.\n- This results in a total of 8 steps, which is the shortest possible path given the constraints.\n\n<think>\nAlright, based on the analysis, the optimal path is determined by moving down three times, then left once, and finally left three more times to reach the destination.

The starting point here is (2,0), which is somewhere near the left side but not too high or low vertically. My destination is (1,4), which seems like it's more towards the upper middle part of the grid. \n\nFirst off, let me visualize the grid. Since it's 6x6, rows go from 0 to 5 and columns also from 0 to 5. So my start is at (2,0)\u2014that would be third row if we count from zero? Wait no\u2014actually, wait\u2014the first coordinate might represent the row index as per usual matrix notation where (row, column). But sometimes people think differently... Hmm, maybe better just stick with what was given earlier. Oh yeah, according to instructions, (0,0) is top-left corner, meaning higher numbers move downwards for both coordinates?\n\nWait actually, perhaps confusion arises because usually grids can vary how they're indexed. Let me clarify:\n\nIn programming terms, often arrays use (row, column) indices where increasing row moves downward and increasing column moves to the right. So yes, assuming standard Cartesian-like system where moving Right increases x-coordinate and Moving Down increases y-coordinate\u2014but since our grid starts at (0,0) being top-left, then going \"down\" would increase the second number when written as (y,x)? Or does movement affect different axes depending on perspective...\n\nHmm, regardless, probably safest assumption based on problem statement is that movements correspond directly to changing either X or Y directionally\u2014if someone says 'right', their column increments, etc., similar to typical grid systems used in computer graphics.\n\nBut okay, stepping back\u2014I'm supposed to plan a path from (2,0) to (1,4).\n\nNow there\u2019s an obstacle at (5,0). That must mean one square below the starting point has something blocking us\u2014it could block certain paths through lower areas.\n\nSo looking at possible directions from (2,0):\n\nFrom (2,0): Possible initial steps include Up, Down, Left, Right. However, considering boundaries\u2014for example, trying to go beyond the edges isn't allowed unless specified otherwise, though typically such problems assume staying within bounds.\n\nLet me list all possibilities:\n\nAt (2,0):\nPossible Moves:\n- Up \u2192 (1,0)\n- Down \u2192 (3,0)\n- Right \u2192 (2,1)\n- Left \u2192 Not possible, since column=0 cannot decrease further\n\nSimilarly, other points will have constraints accordingly.\n\nGiven that Obstacle exists only at (5,0); so positions adjacent may still pass around them except exactly at those spots.\n\nMy goal is to reach (1,4). Starting at (2,0), so overall change needed is Row decreases by 1, Column increases by 4 units.\n\nIdea: Maybe try to head upwards initially to clear the obstacle at (5,0)?\n\nBecause if I go straight right, passing through some cells, but whether that leads into trouble depends on the presence of obstacles elsewhere\u2014or do I know anything else besides (5,0) is blocked?\n\nLooking again at task description: It mentions only one obstacle at (5,0). So rest should be free space apart from that single spot.\n\nTherefore, theoretically, multiple routes exist, but due to limited information, I'll proceed methodically.\n\nOption 1: Move Up immediately.\nStarting Point: (2,0)\n\nMove Up once\u2192(1,0).\nThen next options: From (1,0), can move Up again to (0,0), or Right to (1,1), or even Back Down to (2,0)... Probably want forward progress toward target.\n\nIf after two Ups reaching (0,0), now from there, potential moves: Up won\u2019t help anymore\u2014as already at top edge\u2014and needs to move Right four times to reach (0,4). Then possibly adjust Rows upward.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: After getting closer to the desired area via ups and rights.\n\nAnother thought process: Perhaps using BFS algorithm conceptually\u2014to explore shortest path ignoring obstructions\u2014which gives minimal steps.\n\nHowever, since manual thinking, let's see alternative approaches.\n\nAlternative Approach Steps:\n\nStart at (2,0). Target is (1,4). Obstacle at (5,0).\n\nOne idea is to navigate above the obstacle. Because obstacle is at (5,0), which is far away horizontally compared to current location.\n\nSince starting at (2,0), heading north (upwards) brings us close to the obstacle region laterally but doesn't interfere yet.\n\nMoving Up twice gets us to (0,0). At (0,0), we\u2019re constrained\u2014we can't go further up, nor left (since stuck at boundary). So from (0,0), most efficient route is to move right until we hit column 4\u2014that'd take 4 steps eastward to (0,4). Then, from (0,4), we\u2019d need to move south once to (1,4). Total steps: 2 Ups + 4 Rights + 1 Down =7 steps.\n\nIs that feasible? Are these intermediate squares unblocked? Yes\u2014they don't mention any obstacles anywhere else aside from (5,0). Therefore, safe passage.\n\nBut hold on\u2014isn't (0,0)'s East neighbor (0,1), which hasn't been mentioned as obstructed. Similarly, proceeding along (0,0)->(0,1)->(0,2)->(0,3)->(0,4) is fine.\n\nOnce reached (0,4), moving South to (1,4) requires checking if (1,4) itself is accessible. No issues noted regarding its status.\n\nThus total path length is manageable.\n\nOther Options:\n\nWhat If instead of moving entirely Up first, mix between Up and Right early on?\n\nFor instance, Start at (2,0). First move Up to (1,0). Next, move Right thrice to (1,3). Then move Down three times to (4,3). Then continue Right to (4,4), then Up to (3,4), then Up to (2,4), then Up to (1,4). This seems longer than previous option requiring many steps.\n\nMoreover, why complicate things unnecessarily? Going straight Up reduces steps significantly.\n\nHence, likely Optimal Path is UU followed by RRRRDDDD? Wait, no\u2014from (0,0) needing to go to (0,4)=four Rs, then D.\n\nTotal steps: 2 Us, 4 Rs, 1 D => seven steps.\n\nCheck if any of these passes over forbidden zones\u2014in particular, check if during the journey, say, (0,y) for y>=0 is ever problematic. As none were mentioned, hence acceptable.\n\nAdditionally, verify that final destination (1,4) is reachable without crossing (5,0). Which shouldn't happen under normal circumstances.\n\nConclusion: The straightforward path of moving Up twice, then Right four times, ending with a Down step yields a valid solution with minimum steps.\n\nPotential Alternative Paths:\n\nSuppose alternatively, from (2,0), move Right several times to bypass the obstacle indirectly.\n\nE.g.: (2,0) -> (2,1) -> ...-> (2,4). Then move Up five times to (from (2,4)) to (-3,4), which obviously goes outside the grid. Hence invalid.\n\nNope, that wouldn't work.\n\nOr, alternately, move Right past the obstacle somehow, but since obstacle is located much farther down, i.e., same column but deeper row-wise, moving Right would keep it distant enough.\n\nPerhaps another strategy: From (2,0), move Right to (2,1), then Down to (3,1), then Right to (3,2), ..., but that complicates matters and takes extra steps.\n\nComparing efficiency, original plan remains shorter.\n\nFinal Plan:\n\nStep-by-step actions:\n\n1. Move Up from (2,0) to (1,0)\n2. Move Up again to (0,0)\n3. Move Right four times sequentially to arrive at (0,4)\n   - Step 3a: (0,0) \u2192 (0,1)\n   - Step 3b: (0,1) \u2192 (0,2)\n   - Step 3c: (0,2) \u2192 (0,3)\n   - Step 3d: (0,3) \u2192 (0,4)\n4. Finally, move Down once to (1,4)\n\nThis totals six movements: Two Ups, Four Rights, One Down.\n\nDouble-checking for validity against known obstacles\u2014all passed safely.\n\nYes, looks solid.\n\n**Summary:**  \nOptimal Path: Up, Up, Right, Right, Right, Right, Down  \n\nWhich translates to the action string: \"UUURRRD\"\n</think>\n\nThe optimal path involves navigating from (2,0) to (1,4) by moving Up twice, then Right four times, and finally Down once. This avoids the obstacle at (5,0) efficiently.\n\n| summary |\n|----------|\n| optimal Path: UP, UP, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN |\n\n<think>\n\nAlright, let's break this down systematically.\n\nWe begin at (2,0) aiming to reach (1,4) on a 6x6 grid with an obstacle at (5,0). Our primary objective is to find the shortest path while avoiding the obstacle.\n\n### Initial Analysis:\n- **Obstacles**: Only present at (5,0), nowhere else affects our path.\n- **Movement Constraints**: Can move Up, Down, Left, or Right, ensuring we stay within grid boundaries.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Direct Route Consideration**: Moving directly towards the target generally minimizes steps.\n2. **Avoidance Strategy**: Prioritize moving North (Up) to circumvent the obstacle at (5,0), especially since it blocks access to lower rows effectively.\n\n### Step-by-Step Path Calculation:\n\n#### Phase 1: Ascend Vertically\n- Starting at (2,0), moving Up twice navigates us to (0,0). This clears the immediate vicinity beneath us, allowing future horizontal expansion without interference.\n\n#### Phase 2: Expand Horizontally\n- From (0,0), moving Right four consecutive steps advances us to (0,4). Each Right increment ensures steady progression towards the target column.\n\n#### Phase 3: Descent Vertically\n- Once at (0,4), a single Down move transitions us seamlessly to (1,4), completing the journey.\n\n### Validation Against Obstacles:\nThroughout this trajectory, every visited node checks out as non-obstructed. Specifically, neither (5,0) nor any other nodes along the path contain obstacles.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy prioritizing vertical ascents to create room for necessary lateral expansions, we achieve an efficient path minimizing unnecessary detours. This results in a smooth transition from the starting point to the target, adhering strictly to movement rules and avoiding conflicts with existing obstacles.\n\n</think>\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe optimal path consists of ascending vertically to allow sufficient horizontal clearance, expanding sideways to cover necessary ground, and concluding descent to meet the endpoint precisely.\n\n|summary|\n|--------|\n|optimal Path: UP, UP, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN|\n\n```plaintext\nActions: U U R R R R D\n```\n\n---",

The starting point here is (2,3), which if I remember correctly, rows go vertically and columns horizontally. So (2,3) would be somewhere towards the bottom left since it's closer to row index 2 but still not too far off. My destination is (5,4), which should be near the bottom edge because both coordinates are high except for maybe one being lower? Wait no\u2014(5,4): x=5, y=4... Hmm, actually wait\u2014the first number might represent the row or the column depending on how we're interpreting it. Oh! In grids like these, sometimes people use different conventions. But according to the problem statement, (0,0) is the top-left corner, meaning higher numbers move downward along the rows. Similarly, moving right increases the second coordinate. \n\nSo let me clarify:\n\nIn programming terms, often arrays start with indices where increasing the first element moves downwards, similar to matrices. For example, matrix[0][0] is top-left, then as i increases, you go down the rows. Columns increase going to the right. So yes, (row, column).\n\nTherefore, our task starts at (2,3)\u2014so third row counting from zero upwards, fourth column over four zeros perhaps?\n\nWait, hold on\u2014if there\u2019s confusion between whether the tuple represents (column, row) vs (row, column)... Let me think again based on standard Cartesian systems used elsewhere. Typically, when given points like (y,x), they refer to vertical and horizontal positions respectively. Since the user mentioned \"top-left\" corresponds to (0,0), probably their system uses (row, column)=coordinates such that movement upward decreases the row value, etc., just like typical image processing.\n\nBut regardless, assuming all movements can only change either row +1/-1 or column +/-1 steps\u2014but direction depends on what counts as Up/down/left/right relative to current position.\n\nGiven that, my goal is to find an optimal path from (2,3) to (5,4) on a 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (5,0). Also note that some other cells may also potentially block paths unless specified otherwise\u2014I assume others aren't blocked beyond (5,0); though better confirm later.\n\nFirstly, plotting possible routes considering the single obstacle at (5,0):\n\nThe target location is (5,4), which seems quite close\u2014it's five units below (since rows count from 0?), but looking back, initial tasks had destinations varying\u2014for instance, earlier examples went into more complex setups.\n\nLet me map out potential directions:\n\nStarting Point S = (2,3)\n\nDestination D = (5,4)\n\nObstacle O = (5,0)\n\nI'll try drawing a mental picture:\n\nRow-wise progression needed: From row 2 to row 5\u2014that requires three steps down (each step adds 1 to the row index). Alternatively, could stay within same row via lateral movements until reaching desired spot.\n\nColumn-wise progress: Need to go from column 3 to column 4\u2014a simple rightward step once reached correct row(s).\n\nHowever, the presence of an obstacle at (5,0) complicates things. Obstacles cannot be stepped upon\u2014they must be avoided entirely.\n\nLooking directly above the obstacle, say around its vicinity, but since the obstacle itself is at (5,0), which is fifth row, very low column. Our destination is much further east\u2014at (5,4). Therefore, direct south-east approach isn\u2019t feasible due to needing to pass through forbidden area.\n\nAlternative approaches include detouring northwards away from the obstacle\u2014or alternatively, finding another route altogether.\n\nSince the obstacle blocks certain pathways, especially those leading straight down past row 5, perhaps navigating west or east prior to heading toward the destination becomes necessary.\n\nAlternatively, consider moving sideways across nearby rows to bypass the obstruction.\n\nAnother thought\u2014is the obstacle located exactly two rows above the destination? No\u2014in fact, the obstacle is at (5,0), whereas the destination is at (5,4). They share the same row, but separated by several columns. Thus, stepping onto row 5 will require careful navigation around the obstacle.\n\nPerhaps instead of trying to head straight down, take a slightly longer path that goes around the obstacle.\n\nPossible strategies:\n\nOption 1: Move Right twice initially, then Down thrice, then Left appropriately...\n\nNo, wait\u2014from (2,3), moving right takes us to (2,4), then (2,5)? Or does 'right' mean incrementing the column? Yes, typically, right increments the column part.\n\nFrom (2,3):\nMoving right \u2192 (2,4),\nAgain right\u2192 (2,5),\n\nThen proceed down to reach (5,5)?\n\nHmm, but after getting to (2,5), moving down multiple times gets us to (5,5). Then, finally, moving left once brings us to (5,4). That works!\n\nIs that allowed? Let's see:\n\nStarts at (2,3).\nActions: R, R.\nNow at (2,5).\nNext actions: D, D, D \u2014 arriving at (5,5).\nFinally L arrives at (5,4).\n\nThat avoids passing through (5,0) completely\u2014as none of these intermediate nodes conflict with the obstacle.\n\nWhat else needs checking\u2014are any of the moved-through cells occupied besides the obstacle? Well, per constraints, only specific obstacle exists at (5,0). Other cells seem free.\n\nThus, total steps taken: 2 rights followed by 3 downs plus 1 left\u2014which totals six steps.\n\nAlternatively, check alternative paths:\n\nSuppose someone tries to go down early:\n\nAt (2,3)->D->(3,3)->D->(4,3)->D->(5,3). At (5,3), now attempting to move right to (5,4). However, (5,0) doesn't interfere here\u2014all safe. So why was thinking about Option 1 even considered? Because the obstacle is at (5,0), which is separate from (5,3). Hence, taking that path wouldn't hit anything.\n\nHence, another valid option is simply moving down thrice, then right once.\n\nWhich gives Steps: D,D,D,R\n\nThis results in fewer steps than previous idea\u2014only four steps versus seven previously.\n\nWait, original plan took 7 steps, new plan takes 4 steps. Which makes sense\u2014heh, obviously prefer shorter path length.\n\nWhy didn't I realize that immediately? Maybe oversighted possibilities.\n\nYes, indeed, moving down thrice reaches (5,3), then moving right once lands precisely at (5,4). This method skips unnecessary lateral movements and thus provides a quicker solution.\n\nMoreover, neither of these paths involves crossing the obstacle zone\u2014we\u2019re safely moving either diagonally or sidestepping around it.\n\nAdditionally, verifying that during traversal, do any of the intermediary cells coincide with the obstacle? Starting at (2,3), moving down leads to (3,3),(4,3),(5,3). None conflicting with (5,0). Moving right afterward to (5,4) is fine.\n\nSimilarly, using the alternate path: Start at (2,3), move right-right-right-down-down-down\u2014wait, hangon, that would involve moving East/East/East, ending up at (2,6?) but nvm, size is 6x6, indexes likely run till 5 inclusive. So maximum column is 5.\n\nAh, okay, so (2,3)+R+R+R=(2,6) exceeds max col 5. Oops mistake.\n\nOops, correction: Grid is 6x6, implying indices range from 0\u20135 for both rows and cols. So (2,3)'s next right is (2,4), then (2,5). Next attempt to move right would exceed bounds, hence invalid.\n\nTherefore, the first strategy involving moving right twice is limited\u2014you can't go beyond column 5. So revisiting options.\n\nIf I'm at (2,3), moving right twice ends at (2,5). Then proceeding down thrice to (5,5), then left once to (5,4). Total steps: RRDDD L => 2+3+1=6 steps.\n\nAlternatively, moving down thrice to (5,3), then right once to (5,4). That's DD D R \u2013 4 steps.\n\nBoth methods work, but latter is faster.\n\nAre there any other ways? Perhaps combining lateral movements among various rows.\n\nFor example, moving right once, then down thrice, then left accordingly\u2026 Not sure if that helps.\n\nE.g.: (2,3) -> R (to 2,4);\nthen DDD (reaches 5,4). Wait, really? If started at (2,3), moving right once puts you at (2,4). Then moving down thrice: Each D increases row by 1, so (3,4), (4,4), (5,4). Done in four steps: R, D, D, D. Perfect.\n\nOh wow, that's cleverer yet simpler. Why hadn't I thought of that sooner?\n\nBecause from (2,3), moving right once allows access to adjacent column, thereby enabling straightforward descent to (5,4) without having to navigate around the obstacle.\n\nIndeed, that's efficient\u2014one extra step compared to the other method, but overall less steps.\n\nSo yeah, the minimal path consists of moving right once, then down thrice.\n\nTotal steps: Four.\n\nCheck if any of these steps cross the obstacle site (5,0). Obviously, (5,0) has nothing to do with (5,4), nor affects the path described.\n\nAlso ensure that all traversed cells are unblocked. As long as (5,0) is the only obstacle, rest are clear.\n\nConclusion: Optimal path is R, D, D, D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n| summary |\n|--------|\n| optimal Path: ['down', 'down', 'down', 'right']  \n\n</think>\n\nTo determine the optimal path from (2,3) to (5,4) on a 6x6 grid while avoiding the obstacle at (5,0), we analyzed several potential routes. After evaluating different strategies, the most efficient path involved moving right once to align with the same column as the destination, followed by descending directly to the target.\n\n### Summary\n\nOptimal Path: ['down', 'down', 'down', 'right']\n\n---\n\n<think>\n\nAlright, let's break this down step-by-step to understand how we arrived at the optimal path.\n\n1. **Understanding the Grid**: We have a 6x6 grid where each cell is identified by its row and column indices ranging from 0 to 5. The starting point is (2,3), and the destination is (5,4). The obstacle is located at (5,0), which we must avoid.\n\n2. **Initial Considerations**: Directly moving down from (2,3) to (5,3) seemed promising because it keeps us aligned with the same column throughout the journey. Once at (5,3), moving right once would bring us directly to the destination (5,4).\n\n3. **Avoiding the Obstacle**: The obstacle is at (5,0), which is significantly west of our intended path. By staying within the same column (column 3) until we reach row 5, we effectively bypass the obstacle region.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Movement**:\n   - Start at (2,3).\n   - Move down three times consecutively to traverse from row 2 to row 5, landing at (5,3).\n   - Finally, move right once to reach (5,4).\n\n5. **Efficiency Check**: This path ensures we minimize the number of steps by reducing redundant movements. Instead of wandering unnecessarily, we follow a direct route that avoids the obstacle efficiently.\n\nBy following this structured analysis, we determined that the shortest and safest path is achieved by descending directly to the target column and then moving right once.\n</think>\n\n|summary|\n|--------|\n| optimal Path: ['down', 'down', 'down', 'right']",

The starting point here is (5,5), which is actually quite far away since grids usually start counting from 0. So if it's a 6x6 grid, then both rows and columns go from 0 to 5. That makes sense because sometimes programming uses zero-based indexing for arrays or coordinates.\n\nThe goal is to reach (2,2), which should be somewhere closer towards the center but not too close considering we're moving within six steps maximum probably? Wait no\u2014actually, movement isn't limited except by obstacles. But let me think more clearly.\n\nFirstly, there\u2019s an obstacle at (5,0). Hmm, okay, so when trying to move around, especially near higher-numbered cells like those with high x-values, I might hit some issues. Let me visualize the grid:\n\nImagine a matrix where each cell can either be free (-1 maybe?) or blocked (like having an obstacle). In our case, only one cell has an obstacle\u2014at (5,0).\n\nSo my task starts at (5,5)\u2014the bottom-right corner\u2014and needs to end at (2,2), which would typically require going left twice and up three times\u2014or something similar\u2014but given possible obstructions due to other paths being blocked?\n\nWait, wait\u2014the problem says \"obstacles\" plural as well. Oh! No\u2014it just mentions one obstacle at (5,0)? Or was that part of another example earlier? Looking back...\n\nNo, looking again, yes\u2014in all these tasks, they mention taking into account certain specific points as obstacles. For instance, first example had an obstacle at (2,1); second at (0,4); third now also seems to refer specifically to (5,0). So perhaps multiple such obstacles exist elsewhere besides that single one mentioned? Or does every 'task' involve exactly one specified obstacle location?\n\nIn this particular current problem statement, under the constraints section, it specifies that the user must take care of an obstacle at (5,0). So yeah, only that one spot is blocked.\n\nTherefore, thinking through how to navigate from (5,5) to (2,2):\n\nLet me sketch mentally what directions could lead us toward the target.\n\nStarting at (5,5): Possible moves initially include Up, Left, Right... Well, Right wouldn\u2019t make much sense unless needed later\u2014if anything, moving further away vertically may help reduce horizontal spread.\n\nBut stepping back, directionally, getting from (5,5) to (2,2) requires decreasing both X and Y values over time. Since movements allowed are four-directional, including diagonals aren't permitted\u2014they\u2019re restricted to orthogonal moves.\n\nHmm, so plan-wise, likely will involve moving upwards primarily until reaching y=2, adjusting along the way.\n\nNow, key thing is to ensure that none of the intermediate positions land on (5,0), though in reality, (5,0) is pretty low on the grid compared to (5,5). So depending on whether the path goes directly upward or takes detours via sides, collision risk varies.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using BFS algorithmic approach would give shortest path automatically, accounting for obstacles. However, since I'm doing manual analysis, let me try mapping potential routes.\n\nOption 1: Move straight up\n\nFrom (5,5):\nMove Up \u2192 (4,5),\nAgain Up \u2192 (3,5),\nThen Up\u2192(2,5).\nAt (2,5), next desired action is to shift left thrice.\nEach Left brings us to lower X-coordinate:\nAfter First Left: (2,4);\nSecond Left: (2,3);\nThird Left: (2,2). \n\nThat works perfectly fine\u2014isn't passing through (5,0)?\n\nYes, because during ascent, we were moving from Row 5 to Rows 4,3,2\u2014all different than 5, hence safe regarding the obstacle at (5,0).

My destination is (3,4), which seems like it's just one block below but further along horizontally. \n\nFirst off, let me visualize the grid. Since it's 6x6, there are indices from 0 to 5 for both rows and columns. So positions range as follows:\n\nRows: 0 (topmost), 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\nColumns: same\u2014leftmost is 0, then goes to 5 on the right.\n\nStarting Point S = (2,1): That would be third row if we count zero-based indexing? Wait no\u2014if rows start at 0, then row index increases going downward. Similarly, columns increase moving to the right. So actually, (2,1) is two units down from the top left corner, first column over. Hmm... Maybe drawing an imaginary grid helps more than trying to mentally map coordinates.\n\nSo my current location is (2,1)\u2014so second row counting from bottom or something else? No wait\u2014the problem says (0,0) is top-left. Oh okay! So higher numbers mean lower rows when looking normally because grids usually increment downwards. But perhaps better not confuse myself with real-world orientation\u2014it\u2019s purely based on coordinate values where increasing x moves rightwards across columns, y upwards?\n\nWait, maybe confusion arises whether movement directions correspond correctly. Let me clarify direction mappings again.\n\nIn programming terms, often arrays grow downwards, meaning that (row+1, col) is southward, etc., depending on how they're indexed. In some contexts, especially game development, Y-axis might represent vertical axis differently\u2014but given standard Cartesian-like system used here, probably assuming (y,x).\n\nBut regardless, key points remain: allowed movements include Up, Down, Left, Right\u2014all four cardinal directions\u2014and must track every position visited during the journey.\n\nNow, what do I know about obstacles? From task description, only specific cells contain obstacles\u2014in particular, in all three tasks provided earlier, single obstacles were present except sometimes multiple ones. For example, in the last sample input mentioned above, \"You are in a 6 by 6 world. There are obstacles that you have to avoid at: (5,0).\" So apparently, these can vary per case\u2014they could even form walls around certain areas making paths non-trivial.\n\nGiven our new scenario: Obstacle(s?) Well, according to instructions, specifically mention was made regarding 'obstacles' being avoided\u2014at least once in previous samples\u2014for instance, \"(2,1)\", \"(0,4)\", \"(5,0)\" respectively. It appears that each test has exactly one obstacle unless otherwise stated\u2014or does it say anything different now? Looking back...\n\nThe user wrote: \"There are obstacles that you have to avoid at: (5,0)\". So yes, singular obstacle located at (5,0); i.e., fifth row, first column\u2014which considering 0-indexing translates into quite low on the grid.\n\nOur goal is to find a path from (2,1) to (3,4) avoiding passage through (5,0). Also note that other parts may also potentially have obstructions beyond those specified\u2014as far as I understand, though, constraints don't specify additional obstacles besides the explicitly listed ones. Or am I misinterpreting\u2014is the list exhaustive? Probably, yeah\u2014I think generally such problems assume that apart from the named obstacles, everything else is passable unless blocked elsewhere.\n\nTherefore, plan accordingly.\n\nLet me outline possible steps.\n\nCurrent position: Start at (2,1)\n\nDestination: End at (3,4)\n\nObstruction: At (5,0)\n\nPossible movements: Up, Down, Left, Right\n\nNeed to move towards target via shortest path possibly, ensuring that none of intermediate steps land on forbidden squares.\n\nI should consider using BFS algorithm due to its optimality in unweighted graphs, guaranteeing minimal number of steps between nodes. However, manually doing this will take longer, but manageable within small grid size.\n\nAlternatively, try to sketch potential routes.\n\nFrom (2,1):\n\nOptions available initially:\n\nMove Up \u2192 (1,1)\n\nMove Down \u2192 (3,1)\n\nMove Right \u2192 (2,2)\n\nMove Left \u2192 Not possible, since minimum column is 0, already at 1.\n\nThus initial options after leaving (2,1):\n\n(1,1), (3,1), (2,2)\n\nWe'll explore them sequentially.\n\nOption 1: Move Up to (1,1)\n\nAt (1,1), next possibilities:\n\nUp\u2192 (0,1)\n\nDown\u2192 (2,1) \u2013 came from here, ignore revisiting.\n\nRight\u2192 (1,2)\n\nLeft\u2192 Can\u2019t, min column=0.\n\nCheck if any adjacent square leads us closer to (3,4)?\n\nMoving Up brings us toward Row 0, which isn't directly helpful yet\u2014we still need to reach Row 3.\n\nSimilarly, Moving Right takes us eastward.\n\nPerhaps Option 1 doesn't seem promising immediately.\n\nOption 2: Move Down to (3,1)\n\nAt (3,1), Next Steps:\n\nUp\u2192 Back to (2,1)\n\nDown\u2192 To (4,1)\n\nRight\u2192 (3,2)\n\nLeft\u2192 Cannot.\n\nLooking ahead, moving East gets us closer to Column 4 needed.\n\nAlso, check if (3,1)'s neighbors interfere with the obstruction at (5,0)? Unlikely, as (5,0) is much farther away.\n\nProceeding East from (3,1) gives access to Columns 2,3,4.\n\nIf proceed straight East until reaching (3,4), that'd require passing through several safe spots.\n\nIs that feasible? Let's see.\n\nFrom (3,1)->East->(3,2),(3,3),(3,4). Yes, straightforward.\n\nHowever, another thought: Is there a shorter path? Because Manhattan distance from (2,1) to (3,4) is |\u0394Y| + |\u0394X|= (3\u22122)+(4\u22121)=1+3=4 steps. If direct EEEE RRRR won't work\u2014that requires five steps, hmm\u2026 Wait, hold on.\n\nNope, sorry, correction: Starting at (2,1), ending at (3,4). \u0394Y is 1 unit South, \u0394X is 3 units East. So total displacement needs 1S and 3E, totaling 4 steps. Therefore, theoretically, a path exists taking precisely 4 steps.\n\nHence, why did I previously think needing five? Perhaps miscalculation.\n\nIndeed, correct calculation shows that the minimal number of steps is indeed 4.\n\nWhich suggests that either moving diagonally somehow, but since diagonal moves aren't permitted, hence requiring orthogonal steps summing their respective displacements.\n\nHmm\u2026\n\nWell, anyway, getting back\u2014to construct a valid path.\n\nAlternative approach: Try to plot a route that avoids stepping onto (5,0).\n\nSince (5,0) is pretty far southeast compared to our starting point (which is mid-northwest?), perhaps it lies outside the immediate vicinity of our intended path.\n\nMeaning, likely, the presence of (5,0) as an obstacle wouldn't obstruct most common pathways from (2,1) to (3,4). Unless someone decides to snake through southern regions, but that complicates things unnecessarily.\n\nAssuming that (5,0) is safely distant enough, perhaps the primary challenge is finding a clear path without crossing itself.\n\nAnother consideration: Are there any hidden barriers formed by surrounding blocks? Like forming a wall blocking exit routes.\n\nFor example, suppose if nearby cells had been blocked, creating a dead end. But in absence of information about other obstacles aside from (5,0), hard to tell.\n\nAnyway, proceeding under assumption that main concern is merely avoiding (5,0).\n\nBack to exploring possible paths.\n\nOption 1: Going Up to (1,1). Then from there, moving East thrice to (1,4)... but that skips the necessary Rows progression.\n\nNot sure.\n\nOption 2: Down to (3,1). Then East to (3,4). This uses 4 steps: D followed by EEE.\n\nThat sounds good.\n\nBut let me verify feasibility.\n\nStart at (2,1):\nStep 1: Down -> (3,1).\nSteps remaining: Need to cover X difference of 3 (from 1 to 4). So Step 2: East to (3,2),\nStep 3: East to (3,3),\nStep 4: East to (3,4).\n\nTotal steps: Four.\n\nDoes this path cross any obstacles? Only checking against known obstacle at (5,0). None of the moved positions coincide with (5,0). Hence, this path is acceptable.\n\nMoreover, is there a possibility of alternative paths with similar length?\n\nYes, e.g.: Instead of moving entirely East, perhaps mix some North/South movements, but that would add unnecessary detours leading to longer overall lengths.\n\nConsidering that the minimal steps required are 4, following the described path suffices.\n\nAdditionally, verifying that each individual step lands on permissible tiles.\n\nEach step:\n\n(2,1) --> (3,1): Valid?\nRow changes from 2 to 3, Col remains 1. So yes, free space.\n\nThen,\n\n(3,1)--> (3,2): Same logic,\n(3,2)--> (3,3),\n(3,3)--> (3,4).\n\nAll transitions are legal, and none hit (5,0).\n\nConclusion: The optimal path consists of moving Down once, then East three times\u2014a total of four actions.\n\nJust want to make absolutely sure that nothing is missed.\n\nAre there any alternate paths with fewer steps? Given that Manhattan Distance dictates minimal steps cannot be less than 4, thus this solution is optimal.\n\nFurthermore, confirming that the order of operations matters only in cases where multiple paths exist with equal minimal steps. But in this context, since the question asks simply for the action sequence, providing one such path is sufficient.\n\nFinalizing thoughts: Seems solid. Proceeded methodically, considered alternatives, checked for validity concerning existing obstacles, ensured compliance with movement rules, and confirmed minimality of found path.\n\n**Summary**\n\nOptimal Path: Down, East, East, East  \n</think>\n\nTo determine the optimal path from (2,1) to (3,4) in a 6x6 grid while avoiding the obstacle at (5,0), follow these steps:\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Grid Layout**: Positions are defined with (row, column), where (0,0) is the top-left corner.\n2. **Movement Constraints**: Only allowed to move Up, Down, Left, or Right.\n3. **Obstacles**: Avoid the cell at (5,0).\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The starting point is (2,1) and the destination is (3,4).\n- The minimal number of steps required is calculated using Manhattan distance: \\( \\Delta Y + \\Delta X = 1 + 3 = 4 \\) steps.\n- An efficient path involves minimizing turns and staying close to the desired direction.\n\n### Path Calculation:\n1. **Initial Direction**: Move Down from (2,1) to (3,1).\n2. **Subsequent Directions**: Continue moving East from (3,1) to navigate towards the destination.\n\n### Verification:\n- Each move checks ensure safety from the obstacle at (5,0).\n- All intermediate positions ((3,1), (3,2), (3,3)) are valid and lead logically to the final destination.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAn optimal path consisting of four steps ensures efficiency and adherence to constraints.\n\n---\n\n<think>\n\nAfter careful analysis, the optimal path starts by moving down to bypass the obstacle region, allowing subsequent eastward progressions to efficiently reach the target without interference.\n\n</think>\n\n| summary |\n|--------|\n| Optimal Path: Down, East, East, East |\n\n```plaintext\nActions: down right right right\n```\n\nThis sequence navigates from (2,1) to (3,4) in four steps, avoiding the obstacle at (5,0) and adheres strictly to movement constraints.\n\n---",

The starting point here is (5,3), which if I remember correctly, since it's zero-based indexing, would be the bottom-middle part of the grid because rows go vertically with higher numbers going down? Wait no, actually wait\u2014(0,0) is the top-left corner, so as we move along positive x-axis, we're moving to the right, increasing columns, but for y or rows, they increase downwards. So maybe my initial thought was wrong\u2014I should think more clearly.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nIn grids like these, sometimes people use different coordinate systems. But according to the problem statement, (0,0) is the top-left cell. That makes sense when thinking of matrices where indices start at 0 both horizontally and vertically. So imagine looking at an image matrix\u2014it starts at the top left. Therefore, coordinates can also be considered similar to pixels' positions.\n\nSo given that, our task is to find a path from (5,3)\u2014which must mean fifth row counting from top, third column\u2014but hold on\u2014if there are six cells per side, then indexes run from 0 to 5 inclusive.

The starting point here is (5,4), which is pretty far to the bottom-right corner since it's zero-indexed\u2014so actually, if we think of rows as going downwards like maps usually do, but wait no\u2014the problem says (0,0) is the top-left. So maybe my mental model should be adjusted accordingly. Let me clarify:\n\nIn programming grids, often (row, column) where row increases downward and columns increase to the right makes sense because when you look at pixels or matrix indices, higher y values go down. But according to the instruction given earlier, for example, one task was moving from (0,1) to somewhere else with certain actions. Hmm, perhaps regardless of how they're stored internally, movement directions can still be thought of as Up/down/left/right based on their coordinates relative to each other.\n\nSo let's parse all details again:\n\nThe current task has these parameters:\n\nGrid size: 6x6\n\nObstacles: At (5,0)\n\nStart Point: (5,4)\n\nEnd Point: (2,4)\n\nWait\u2014that seems interesting because both start and end points share the same x-coordinate? Wait, hold on\u2014if (5,4) starts there, then ending at (2,4)\u2014same column?\n\nYes! Because looking back, the first parameter after \"obstacles\" is just an integer indicating whether multiple obstacles exist\u2014but in our case, only one obstacle exists at (5,0).\n\nBut now, trying to move from (5,4) to (2,4): straight left along the fourth column would take us through cells (5,4)->(4,4)->(3,4)->(2,4). Are those positions free?\n\nLet\u2019s check what might block them. Obstacle is at (5,0); does that affect anything near (5,4)? Well, unless something blocks vertical lines between different rows... No, except for specific paths being blocked due to walls elsewhere.\n\nAssuming standard grid rules, i.e., adjacent squares cannot pass through unless specified otherwise\u2014or rather, assuming that the presence of an obstacle doesn't necessarily mean every direction around it is blocked\u2014it depends on how exactly the grid looks beyond the provided information.\n\nHmm, but in reality, sometimes problems assume that surrounding areas aren\u2019t obstructed unless stated. However, considering that the user hasn't described more than single obstacles, probably most moves are allowed apart from crossing into forbidden zones.\n\nTherefore, thinking visually, imagine a chessboard-like setup where some squares may not allow passage\u2014for instance, having someone standing next to another could create barriers depending on adjacency.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grid isn't fully mapped aside from knowing that (5,0) is occupied. Therefore, possible obstructions come from either direct blocking via shared edges or corners\u2014which complicates things further.\n\nGiven that, stepping from (5,4):\n\nPossible initial steps include moving Left towards lower-numbered columns within Row=5 until reaching Column=0, but that leads directly past the obstacle at (5,0)?\n\nNo, wait\u2014in coordinate terms, (5,0)'s column is 0, whereas the starting point is (5,4). Moving left once takes us to (5,3), twice to (5,2), thrice to (5,1), four times to (5,0)... Oh, but (5,0) itself is an obstacle\u2014is entering (5,0) prohibited? Yes, per instructions\u2014we must avoid obstacles entirely.\n\nThus, attempting to reach (5,4) -> ...-> (5,0) is impossible because landing on (5,0) is invalid. Hence, alternative routes are necessary.\n\nAlternative approach: Instead of moving purely horizontally across row 5, try to navigate upwards away from the obstacle, possibly using nearby rows.\n\nLooking ahead, target destination is (2,4). That suggests staying in column 4 throughout the journey\u2014a horizontal line upward three units\u2014from row 5 to row 2.\n\nHowever, if moving vertically requires passing through row 5, col 4, etc.\u2014but hang on, why am I getting confused...\n\nWait, sorry\u2014I'm mixing myself up. Starting at (5,4), wanting to get to (2,4). If I were able to traverse east-west freely in row 5, but facing an obstacle at (5,0), meaning I couldn't proceed westward beyond column 0. Since I started at column 4, moving West toward column 0 will hit the obstacle at (5,0) upon arriving there. Thus, stuck.\n\nHence, instead, plan a detour above or below.\n\nSince the goal is also in column 4, perhaps moving northwards initially\u2014to clear the obstacle\u2014and then return south later.\n\nFor example:\n\nFrom (5,4):\nMove North to (4,4),\nThen continue North to (3,4),\nThen North to (2,4),\n\nThat works perfectly\u2014all movements stay in column 4, never touching (5,0). Is that correct?\n\nBecause none of the intermediate nodes interfere with the obstacle at (5,0). Indeed, even though (5,0) is blocked, nothing prevents traversing entire column 4 from row 5 to row 2\u2014as long as such traversal passes over empty spaces.\n\nIs there any reason why that wouldn't work? For instance, suppose that somehow moving north affects neighboring cells' accessibility, but generally, in typical grid-based pathfinding, orthogonal movement allows changing rows independently as needed.\n\nMoreover, checking the number of steps involved: From (5,4) to (2,4) involves descending three levels\u2014each 'up' action reduces the row index by 1. So total of 3 'up' actions.\n\nWhich matches the sample input two mentioned previously\u2014they had similar setups\u2014with solutions involving simple directional changes.\n\nAnother consideration: Could there be shorter paths? In this scenario, yes, but minimal distance-wise, moving strictly up is already efficient.\n\nAre there any potential hidden obstacles besides (5,0)?

        "optimal_path": "optimal Path: [Movements sequence]\n    \n    <Think> \nOkay, so I need to figure out the best way to get from point A to point B on a 6x6 grid without hitting any obstacles. The starting point here is (5,4), which is pretty far to the bottom-right corner since it's zero-indexed\u2014so actually, if we think of rows as going downwards like maps usually do, but wait no\u2014the problem says (0,0) is the top-left. So maybe my mental model should be adjusted accordingly. Let me clarify:\n\nIn programming grids, often (row, column) where row increases downward and columns increase to the right makes sense because when you look at pixels or matrix indices, higher y values go down. But according to the instruction given earlier, for example, one task was moving from (0,1) to somewhere else with certain actions. Hmm, perhaps regardless of how they're stored internally, movement directions can still be thought of as Up/down/left/right based on their coordinates relative to each other.\n\nSo let's parse all details again:\n\nThe current task has these parameters:\n\nGrid size: 6x6\n\nObstacles: At (5,0)\n\nStart Point: (5,4)\n\nEnd Point: (2,4)\n\nWait\u2014that seems interesting because both start and end points share the same x-coordinate? Wait, hold on\u2014if (5,4) starts there, then ending at (2,4)\u2014same column?\n\nYes! Because looking back, the first parameter after \"obstacles\" is just an integer indicating whether multiple obstacles exist\u2014but in our case, only one obstacle exists at (5,0).\n\nBut now, trying to move from (5,4) to (2,4): straight left along the fourth column would take us through cells (5,4)->(4,4)->(3,4)->(2,4). Are those positions free?\n\nLet\u2019s check what might block them. Obstacle is at (5,0); does that affect anything near (5,4)? Well, unless something blocks vertical lines between different rows... No, except for specific paths being blocked due to walls elsewhere.\n\nAssuming standard grid rules, i.e., adjacent squares cannot pass through unless specified otherwise\u2014or rather, assuming that the presence of an obstacle doesn't necessarily mean every direction around it is blocked\u2014it depends on how exactly the grid looks beyond the provided information.\n\nHmm, but in reality, sometimes problems assume that surrounding areas aren\u2019t obstructed unless stated. However, considering that the user hasn't described more than single obstacles, probably most moves are allowed apart from crossing into forbidden zones.\n\nTherefore, thinking visually, imagine a chessboard-like setup where some squares may not allow passage\u2014for instance, having someone standing next to another could create barriers depending on adjacency.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grid isn't fully mapped aside from knowing that (5,0) is occupied. Therefore, possible obstructions come from either direct blocking via shared edges or corners\u2014which complicates things further.\n\nGiven that, stepping from (5,4):\n\nPossible initial steps include moving Left towards lower-numbered columns within Row=5 until reaching Column=0, but that leads directly past the obstacle at (5,0)?\n\nNo, wait\u2014in coordinate terms, (5,0)'s column is 0, whereas the starting point is (5,4). Moving left once takes us to (5,3), twice to (5,2), thrice to (5,1), four times to (5,0)... Oh, but (5,0) itself is an obstacle\u2014is entering (5,0) prohibited? Yes, per instructions\u2014we must avoid obstacles entirely.\n\nThus, attempting to reach (5,4) -> ...-> (5,0) is impossible because landing on (5,0) is invalid. Hence, alternative routes are necessary.\n\nAlternative approach: Instead of moving purely horizontally across row 5, try to navigate upwards away from the obstacle, possibly using nearby rows.\n\nLooking ahead, target destination is (2,4). That suggests staying in column 4 throughout the journey\u2014a horizontal line upward three units\u2014from row 5 to row 2.\n\nHowever, if moving vertically requires passing through row 5, col 4, etc.\u2014but hang on, why am I getting confused...\n\nWait, sorry\u2014I'm mixing myself up. Starting at (5,4), wanting to get to (2,4). If I were able to traverse east-west freely in row 5, but facing an obstacle at (5,0), meaning I couldn't proceed westward beyond column 0. Since I started at column 4, moving West toward column 0 will hit the obstacle at (5,0) upon arriving there. Thus, stuck.\n\nHence, instead, plan a detour above or below.\n\nSince the goal is also in column 4, perhaps moving northwards initially\u2014to clear the obstacle\u2014and then return south later.\n\nFor example:\n\nFrom (5,4):\nMove North to (4,4),\nThen continue North to (3,4),\nThen North to (2,4),\n\nThat works perfectly\u2014all movements stay in column 4, never touching (5,0). Is that correct?\n\nBecause none of the intermediate nodes interfere with the obstacle at (5,0). Indeed, even though (5,0) is blocked, nothing prevents traversing entire column 4 from row 5 to row 2\u2014as long as such traversal passes over empty spaces.\n\nIs there any reason why that wouldn't work? For instance, suppose that somehow moving north affects neighboring cells' accessibility, but generally, in typical grid-based pathfinding, orthogonal movement allows changing rows independently as needed.\n\nMoreover, checking the number of steps involved: From (5,4) to (2,4) involves descending three levels\u2014each 'up' action reduces the row index by 1. So total of 3 'up' actions.\n\nWhich matches the sample input two mentioned previously\u2014they had similar setups\u2014with solutions involving simple directional changes.\n\nAnother consideration: Could there be shorter paths? In this scenario, yes, but minimal distance-wise, moving strictly up is already efficient.\n\nAre there any potential hidden obstacles besides (5,0)? As per the question statement, only (5,0) is present\u2014an obstacle. All others presumably open.\n\nAdditionally, ensuring that during the movement, especially when approaching closer proximity to the obstacle, don't inadvertently cross its vicinity diagonally or indirectly.\n\nBut in this particular case, moving solely in the northern direction keeps everything aligned correctly.\n\nTo recapitulate:\n\nStarting at (5,4).\nActions available: Up, Down, Right, Left.\nGoal is (2,4).\n\nAttempting to move Up repeatedly avoids conflict with (5,0) because we\u2019re keeping column fixed at 4, thus bypassing the obstacle located at (5,0).\n\nEach Up brings us closer to the desired endpoint.\n\nTesting feasibility:\n\nStep-by-step:\n\nCurrent position: (5,4)\nAction 1: Up \u2192 (4,4)\nCheck if (4,4) is accessible \u2013 likely yes, as no mention of obstacles there.\nPosition updated.\n\nAction 2: Up \u2192 (3,4)\nAgain, assuming unblocked area.\n\nAction 3: Up \u2192 (2,4)\nTarget reached successfully.\n\nTotal Steps: 3 Ups.\n\nThis appears straightforward and valid under constraints.\n\nPotential concerns: Did I miss any alternate route possibilities?

The starting point here is (5,1), which if I remember correctly, rows go vertically and columns horizontally. So (5,1) would be somewhere near the bottom since it's row index 5? Wait no, actually wait\u2014(0,0) is the top-left corner, meaning higher row numbers move downward. So yeah, (5,1) should indeed be towards the lower part of the grid but not too far because there might still be some space above or below depending on where other points lie.\n\nThe target is (4,0). Hmm, okay, moving leftwards probably isn't an option unless blocked. Let me visualize the grid:\n\nRows are numbered 0 to 5, with 0 being the topmost. Columns also range from 0 to 5, again 0 on the left. So our start is (5,1)\u2014that\u2019s fifth row, first column\u2014but wait, hold on\u2014isn\u2019t (row, column)? Or maybe sometimes people think differently... No, according to standard matrix notation, yes\u2014it'd make sense for grids as well. But let me confirm once more\u2014if we're using Cartesian coordinates like computer graphics, then y increases downwards when looking at screen positions, similar to matrices. So perhaps (5,1) is five units down along the Y-axis?\n\nWait, regardless\u2014I just need to map these properly based on given instructions. Since they say (0,0) is top-left, movement directions will follow accordingly. So going 'up' decreases the row number, 'down' increases it, same logic applies for columns\u2014their direction depends on whether increasing moves us further into something else.\n\nBut stepping back, what do we know? We\u2019re supposed to find a path from (5,1) to (4,0) in a 6x6 grid. Obstacles exist only at specific cells\u2014in this case, one obstacle at (5,0).\n\nSo my task is to plan such a route considering all possible movements except those leading directly onto the obstacle(s). Also, allowed movements include Up, Down, Left, Right\u2014all four cardinal directions\u2014and every step must track its position accurately until reaching destination.\n\nFirstly, plotting both the start and end points relative to the obstacle could help understand potential paths better.\n\nStart Point S = (5,1): That's last row, second column.\nEnd Point T = (4,0): Second-last row, first column.\nObstacle O = (5,0): Same row as Start, adjacent to it diagonally across.\n\nLooking at their positions, trying to see direct routes between them may involve either moving upwards toward Row 4, Column 1, but passing through (5,0) which has an obstacle\u2014or alternatively, finding another way around.\n\nSince the obstacle is located exactly at (5,0), which shares the same row as the start point but different column. Therefore, attempting to reach End Point via moving straight up from (5,1) leads immediately past the obstacle\u2014that seems safe though! Because moving from (5,1) upward takes us to (4,1); next steps can take us closer to Target.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps taking a detour due to some constraints elsewhere, but in this scenario, does anything block the straightforward path?\n\nLet me consider the initial thought process. If I try to move up three times from (5,1):\n\nStep 1: Move Up \u2192 (4,1)\n\nThen Step 2: Move Up \u2192 (3,1)\n\nStep 3: Move Up \u2192 (2,1)\n\nHmm, now after two steps, am I getting close enough? Alternatively, perhaps moving sideways instead...\n\nWait, but why complicate things unnecessarily? Maybe the shortest path doesn't require any sidestepping beyond possibly moving away temporarily.\n\nHold on, the problem says \"obstacles\" plural\u2014\"there are obstacles\"\u2014but in the third example provided earlier, the user had specified multiple obstacles, but in this current problem statement, only one obstacle exists\u2014at (5,0). So single obstacle blocking certain areas.\n\nGiven that, let's re-examine the layout.\n\nFrom Starting Point (5,1):\nPossible immediate moves: Up\u2192(4,1), Down\u2192invalid (since max row is 5?), assuming boundaries aren't mentioned otherwise. Wait, Grid size is 6x6\u2014which implies indices run from 0 to 5 inclusive. Hence, cannot go beyond those limits.\n\nSimilarly, Left from (5,1) goes to invalid (-1?) Not sure, but likely considered impossible. Similarly, Right from (5,1) gives (5,2).\n\nTherefore, available options initially are Up and Right.\n\nIf I choose to move Up, heading towards (4,1), etc., whereas choosing Right brings me to (5,2), potentially allowing alternative pathways.\n\nNow, thinking about the obstacle location: (5,0). So in row 5, column 0 is blocked. Thus, in row 5 itself, besides (5,0), others seem free\u2014as per the instruction, only (5,0) is occupied.\n\nHence, in terms of navigating from (5,1) to (4,0), the key issue is ensuring that during traversal, none of the intermediate squares land on (5,0).\n\nIn order words, moving from (5,1) to anywhere requires careful consideration\u2014not crossing over forbidden zones.\n\nHowever, note that (5,1)'s neighboring square includes (5,0), which is blocked. So whenever someone tries to enter (5,0), they hit a wall. However, leaving (5,1) via other directions avoids that.\n\nThus, strategy-wise, perhaps proceed primarily by moving Upward rather than making lateral moves aside from necessary ones.\n\nStarting at (5,1):\n\nOption 1: Move Up\n\nMove 1: From (5,1) -> (4,1)\n\nIs (4,1) clear? Yes, nothing said about that spot.\n\nNext Option: Continue Moving Up\n\nMove 2: (4,1)->(3,1)\n\nStill open.\n\nAnother Up:\n\nMove 3:(3,1)->(2,1)\n\nContinuing similarly,\n\nMove 4: (2,1)->(1,1)\n\nMove 5: (1,1)->(0,1)\n\nAt this point, having moved up five steps gets us to (0,1). Then, from (0,1), we want to head towards (4,0). How?\n\nWell, from (0,1), moving Right won't lead us forward much\u2014we\u2019d stay within row zero. Instead, moving Down wouldn't change the row. Alternatively, moving Left from (0,1) would bring us to (0,0), which is unblocked.\n\nMoving Left twice:\n\nMove 6: (0,1)->(0,0)\n\nMove7: (0,0)-> ?\n\nWait, but (0,0) is accessible, correct? It was never listed as an obstacle.\n\nAfter arriving at (0,0), we can attempt to navigate down-right towards (4,0)?\n\nNo, because (0,0) is already quite high compared to desired endpoint (4,0). To get to (4,0), we'll need to increase the row count\u2014from 0 to 4.\n\nEach step down increments the row value.\n\nSo from (0,0):\n\nMove8: (0,0)->(1,0)\n\nMove9: (1,0)->(2,0)\n\nMove10: (2,0)->(3,0)\n\nMove11: (3,0)->(4,0)\n\nThat completes the journey!\n\nTotal Steps: 11.\n\nAlternative approach: Could we have taken fewer steps?\n\nPerhaps, but let's check feasibility.\n\nWait, but hang on\u2014are we allowed to pass through (0,0)? Is that acceptable under the rules? Well, the constraint mentions only obstacles explicitly stated\u2014they didn't mention walls everywhere outside the grid edges, implying that edge borders don't pose issues.\n\nMoreover, even if (0,0) were somehow obstructed, it wasn't indicated here.\n\nAdditionally, checking the path segments:\n\nFrom (5,1) to (4,1)... All good.\n\nProceeding to (0,1), then to (0,0), then climbing down to (4,0). Each segment is valid.\n\nThis results in total steps: 11.\n\nAn alternative idea: Perhaps deviating slightly early allows shorter overall distance.\n\nFor instance, suppose from (5,1), instead of moving entirely Up, we mix some rights or downs.\n\nBut given that moving down from (5,1) is impossible\u2014you can't decrease row less than 0\u2014so moving down is stuck anyway.\n\nWhat about moving Right from (5,1) to (5,2). Then proceeding Up.\n\nWould that offer a shortcut?\n\nLet's explore:\n\nMove1: (5,1)->R->(5,2)\n\nCheck if (5,2) is blocked? Only (5,0) is mentioned, hence OK.\n\nMove2: U->(4,2)\n\nMove3: U->(3,2)\n\nMove4: U->(2,2)\n\nMove5: U->(1,2)\n\nMove6: U->(0,2)\n\nMove7: L->(0,1)\n\nMove8: L->(0,0)\n\nSame as previous method, ending up needing additional steps to climb down.\n\nIt adds extra steps, resulting in longer path length.\n\nNot ideal.\n\nAlternatively, from (0,2), perhaps moving D-R-L-D\u2026 but that complicates matters.\n\nSeems worse off.\n\nBacktracking thoughts: Another possibility is to use BFS algorithmically, treating nodes as grid positions connected by allowable moves, excluding obstacles.\n\nBFS ensures minimal-step solutions.\n\nAssuming that, applying BFS manually:\n\nInitialize queue with (5,1). Mark visited set including (5,1).\n\nLevel 0: [(5,1)]\n\nProcess Level 0 node (5,1):\n\nGenerate neighbors:\n\nU: (4,1) \u2013 add to queue, mark visited.\n\nD: Invalid (can't go beyond row 5).\n\nL: (5,0) \u2013 obstacle, skip.\n\nR: (5,2) \u2013 add to queue, mark visited.\n\nQueue becomes level 1: [(4,1),(5,2)].\n\nMark levels appropriately.\n\nProcessing Node (4,1):\n\nNeighbors:\n\nU: (3,1) \u2013 new, enqueue.\n\nD: (5,1) \u2013 already visited.\n\nL: (4,0) \u2013 target found! So path ends here.\n\nWait, processing (4,1) generates neighbor (4,0), which is the target. So the path is (5,1) -> (4,1) -> (4,0). Two steps?! Seems too easy.\n\nBut did I miss something?\n\nBecause previously, I thought that moving from (5,1) to (4,1) and then to (4,0) is feasible.\n\nChecking validity:\n\nAre (4,1) and (4,0) reachable?\n\nYes, neither contain obstacles.\n\nOnly (5,0) is blocked.\n\nSo, thus, the minimal path consists of two steps: Up followed by Left.\n\nWhy did prior analysis suggest eleven steps? Probably got confused regarding the coordinate system.\n\nAh, confusion arises from differing interpretations of grid orientation.\n\nEarlier assumption treated (Row, Column) as x,y axes\u2014with Rows decreasing upwards and Columns increasing to the right.\n\nUnder that model, (5,1) is sixth row, second column.\n\nTo reach (4,0), fourth row, first column.\n\nDirectly north-west diagonal.\n\nBut in reality, moving west from (5,1) lands on (5,0), which is blocked.\n\nInstead, moving North to (4,1), then West to (4,0) is permissible.\n\nIndeed, that makes perfect sense.\n\nI think my mistake came from misapplying the grid structure\u2014forgetting that moving West from (5,1) hits the obstacle, preventing that particular turn.\n\nConsequently, the correct path involves moving Up to (4,1), then Left to (4,0).\n\nWhich totals two steps.\n\nWow, that simplifies everything.\n\nProbably, in the initial assessment, I incorrectly assumed that moving East-West laterally would interfere, but upon reflection, moving Up first circumvents the obstacle.\n\nConclusion: Minimal path is simply two actions: Up, then Left.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n| summary |\n|--------|\n| optimal Path: UP, LEFT |\n\n\\boxed{UP, LEFT}\n</think>\n\nTo determine the optimal path from (5,1) to (4,0) in a 6x6 grid while avoiding the obstacle at (5,0), we need to carefully consider each possible move.\n\n1. **Understanding the Grid**: The grid starts at (0,0) as the top-left corner.

Thus, in row 5 itself, besides (5,0), others seem free\u2014as per the instruction, only (5,0) is occupied.\n\nHence, in terms of navigating from (5,1) to (4,0), the key issue is ensuring that during traversal, none of the intermediate squares land on (5,0).\n\nIn order words, moving from (5,1) to anywhere requires careful consideration\u2014not crossing over forbidden zones.\n\nHowever, note that (5,1)'s neighboring square includes (5,0), which is blocked. So whenever someone tries to enter (5,0), they hit a wall. However, leaving (5,1) via other directions avoids that.\n\nThus, strategy-wise, perhaps proceed primarily by moving Upward rather than making lateral moves aside from necessary ones.\n\nStarting at (5,1):\n\nOption 1: Move Up\n\nMove 1: From (5,1) -> (4,1)\n\nIs (4,1) clear? Yes, nothing said about that spot.\n\nNext Option: Continue Moving Up\n\nMove 2: (4,1)->(3,1)\n\nStill open.\n\nAnother Up:\n\nMove 3:(3,1)->(2,1)\n\nContinuing similarly,\n\nMove 4: (2,1)->(1,1)\n\nMove 5: (1,1)->(0,1)\n\nAt this point, having moved up five steps gets us to (0,1). Then, from (0,1), we want to head towards (4,0). How?\n\nWell, from (0,1), moving Right won't lead us forward much\u2014we\u2019d stay within row zero. Instead, moving Down wouldn't change the row. Alternatively, moving Left from (0,1) would bring us to (0,0), which is unblocked.\n\nMoving Left twice:\n\nMove 6: (0,1)->(0,0)\n\nMove7: (0,0)-> ?\n\nWait, but (0,0) is accessible, correct? It was never listed as an obstacle.\n\nAfter arriving at (0,0), we can attempt to navigate down-right towards (4,0)?\n\nNo, because (0,0) is already quite high compared to desired endpoint (4,0). To get to (4,0), we'll need to increase the row count\u2014from 0 to 4.\n\nEach step down increments the row value.\n\nSo from (0,0):\n\nMove8: (0,0)->(1,0)\n\nMove9: (1,0)->(2,0)\n\nMove10: (2,0)->(3,0)\n\nMove11: (3,0)->(4,0)\n\nThat completes the journey!\n\nTotal Steps: 11.\n\nAlternative approach: Could we have taken fewer steps?\n\nPerhaps, but let's check feasibility.\n\nWait, but hang on\u2014are we allowed to pass through (0,0)? Is that acceptable under the rules? Well, the constraint mentions only obstacles explicitly stated\u2014they didn't mention walls everywhere outside the grid edges, implying that edge borders don't pose issues.\n\nMoreover, even if (0,0) were somehow obstructed, it wasn't indicated here.\n\nAdditionally, checking the path segments:\n\nFrom (5,1) to (4,1)... All good.\n\nProceeding to (0,1), then to (0,0), then climbing down to (4,0). Each segment is valid.\n\nThis results in total steps: 11.\n\nAn alternative idea: Perhaps deviating slightly early allows shorter overall distance.\n\nFor instance, suppose from (5,1), instead of moving entirely Up, we mix some rights or downs.\n\nBut given that moving down from (5,1) is impossible\u2014you can't decrease row less than 0\u2014so moving down is stuck anyway.\n\nWhat about moving Right from (5,1) to (5,2). Then proceeding Up.\n\nWould that offer a shortcut?\n\nLet's explore:\n\nMove1: (5,1)->R->(5,2)\n\nCheck if (5,2) is blocked? Only (5,0) is mentioned, hence OK.\n\nMove2: U->(4,2)\n\nMove3: U->(3,2)\n\nMove4: U->(2,2)\n\nMove5: U->(1,2)\n\nMove6: U->(0,2)\n\nMove7: L->(0,1)\n\nMove8: L->(0,0)\n\nSame as previous method, ending up needing additional steps to climb down.\n\nIt adds extra steps, resulting in longer path length.\n\nNot ideal.\n\nAlternatively, from (0,2), perhaps moving D-R-L-D\u2026 but that complicates matters.\n\nSeems worse off.\n\nBacktracking thoughts: Another possibility is to use BFS algorithmically, treating nodes as grid positions connected by allowable moves, excluding obstacles.\n\nBFS ensures minimal-step solutions.\n\nAssuming that, applying BFS manually:\n\nInitialize queue with (5,1). Mark visited set including (5,1).\n\nLevel 0: [(5,1)]\n\nProcess Level 0 node (5,1):\n\nGenerate neighbors:\n\nU: (4,1) \u2013 add to queue, mark visited.\n\nD: Invalid (can't go beyond row 5).\n\nL: (5,0) \u2013 obstacle, skip.\n\nR: (5,2) \u2013 add to queue, mark visited.\n\nQueue becomes level 1: [(4,1),(5,2)].\n\nMark levels appropriately.\n\nProcessing Node (4,1):\n\nNeighbors:\n\nU: (3,1) \u2013 new, enqueue.\n\nD: (5,1) \u2013 already visited.\n\nL: (4,0) \u2013 target found! So path ends here.\n\nWait, processing (4,1) generates neighbor (4,0), which is the target. So the path is (5,1) -> (4,1) -> (4,0). Two steps?! Seems too easy.\n\nBut did I miss something?\n\nBecause previously, I thought that moving from (5,1) to (4,1) and then to (4,0) is feasible.\n\nChecking validity:\n\nAre (4,1) and (4,0) reachable?\n\nYes, neither contain obstacles.\n\nOnly (5,0) is blocked.\n\nSo, thus, the minimal path consists of two steps: Up followed by Left.\n\nWhy did prior analysis suggest eleven steps? Probably got confused regarding the coordinate system.\n\nAh, confusion arises from differing interpretations of grid orientation.\n\nEarlier assumption treated (Row, Column) as x,y axes\u2014with Rows decreasing upwards and Columns increasing to the right.\n\nUnder that model, (5,1) is sixth row, second column.\n\nTo reach (4,0), fourth row, first column.\n\nDirectly north-west diagonal.\n\nBut in reality, moving west from (5,1) lands on (5,0), which is blocked.\n\nInstead, moving North to (4,1), then West to (4,0) is permissible.\n\nIndeed, that makes perfect sense.\n\nI think my mistake came from misapplying the grid structure\u2014forgetting that moving West from (5,1) hits the obstacle, preventing that particular turn.\n\nConsequently, the correct path involves moving Up to (4,1), then Left to (4,0).\n\nWhich totals two steps.\n\nWow, that simplifies everything.\n\nProbably, in the initial assessment, I incorrectly assumed that moving East-West laterally would interfere, but upon reflection, moving Up first circumvents the obstacle.\n\nConclusion: Minimal path is simply two actions: Up, then Left.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n| summary |\n|--------|\n| optimal Path: UP, LEFT |\n\n\\boxed{UP, LEFT}\n</think>\n\nTo determine the optimal path from (5,1) to (4,0) in a 6x6 grid while avoiding the obstacle at (5,0), we need to carefully consider each possible move.\n\n1. **Understanding the Grid**: The grid starts at (0,0) as the top-left corner.

The starting point here is (4,5), which if I remember correctly, since it's zero-based indexing, would be near the bottom-right corner because rows go vertically with higher numbers going down? Wait no, actually wait\u2014(0,0) is the top-left, so as we move towards increasing x or y values, do they increase downwards?\n\nWait maybe not necessarily\u2014it depends how people model grids sometimes differently but usually for programming purposes, moving down increases the row index, like matrix indices where first dimension is rows. So yeah, assuming standard Cartesian-like coordinate system where lower coordinates are upper left, then:\n\nSo our start is (4,5)\u2014so fifth row counting from zero upwards, sixth column same idea\u2014but columns might run horizontally. Hmm, perhaps better just think numerically regardless of direction until movement rules come into play.\n\nThe goal is (3,0): third row, first column. Obstacles are present only at one place given\u2014the problem says \"obstacles\" plural\u2014\"at\": (5,0).\n\nOh okay! Only an obstacle at (5,0)? Or was there more than one mentioned earlier? Let me check again.\n\nIn the current task description, under constraints section, it says 'There are obstacles that you have to avoid at: (5,0).' So single obstacle located at (row=5, col=0). \n\nOur job is to find a path from (4,5) to (3,0) using allowed movements Up, Down, Left, Right, making sure none of these steps land us onto (5,0); also track every position along the way.\n\nFirstly, let's visualize the grid mentally. It\u2019s a 6x6 grid meaning indexes range from (0,0) to (5,5):\n\nRows = vertical lines, numbered 0 through 5.\nColumns = horizontal lines, numbered 0 through 5.\n\nStarting Point S=(4,5):\nRow 4, Column 5\n\nGoal G=(3,0):\nRow 3, Column 0\n\nObstacle O=(5,0)\n\nWe can't pass through (5,0). Also note whether other cells may block paths indirectly\u2014if necessary, but according to instructions, seems only specific points are blocked except those implied via being adjacent etc., unless specified otherwise.\n\nBut per instruction, only (5,0) has an obstacle. So all others including surrounding areas should be accessible unless forced due to necessity around the obstacle.\n\nLet me sketch possible routes.\n\nOption 1: Move directly westward toward Goal, but considering the obstacle location.\n\nFrom Start (4,5)-> want to reach (3,0). To get closer, probably needs some combination of moves north/south/east/west depending on what blocks the way.\n\nAlternatively, thinking visually, imagine the grid laid out:\n\nPositions close to the obstacle will require detouring either above or below.\n\nGiven that the obstacle is at (5,0), which is far away both east-west-wise and south-north-wise compared to our start and end positions.\n\nStart is at Row 4, Col 5 \u2014 relatively high row number, middle-high column.\n\nEnd is at Row 3, Col 0 \u2013 low row, very leftmost column.\n\nSo straight line isn\u2019t straightforward because of the obstacle blocking certain directions.\n\nPerhaps plan a route that goes North-West diagonally across multiple squares, but ensuring that when passing over regions, don't hit the obstacle.\n\nAlternative approach could involve stepping back South once to clear the obstacle, though looking at their relative positions...\n\nHmm... Alternatively, consider breaking down the journey into segments.\n\nMaybe try to navigate upward/downward strategically.\n\nAnother thought process: Since the obstacle is at (5,0), which is quite southwest of our starting point, perhaps navigating northwestwards initially won't encounter much trouble.\n\nLooking at the starting square (4,5), its neighbors include:\n\nNorth: (3,5)\nSouth: (5,5)\nEast: (4,6?) No, max column is 5, so East is invalid?\nWest: (4,4)\n\nSimilarly, target area is (3,0), whose neighboring squares are:\n\nNorth: (2,0)\nSouth: (4,0)\nEast: (3,1)\nWest: Invalid beyond edge.\n\nSince the obstacle is at (5,0), which is two units southeast of Target Area. Therefore, to prevent getting stuck between obstacle and target, must ensure that during traversal, we stay sufficiently north of the obstacle.\n\nBecause if we were to head West towards the target, say from (4,5) -> ...-> (4,0), but after reaching somewhere past (5,0)'s influence, i.e., still having sufficient distance North.\n\nWait, another angle: Maybe take a U-turn kind of pattern.\n\nFor example, proceed West several times, then turn North/South accordingly.\n\nOr alternatively, move North enough to bypass the obstacle entirely.\n\nIs it feasible to move North from (4,5)?\n\nYes, moving North takes us to (3,5), next step further North gets to (2,5)... But does that help? Because ultimately, we'd have to traverse East/West too.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps combine North and West movements cleverly.\n\nWait, let's map potential steps.\n\nCurrent position: (4,5).\nPossible initial moves: North, South, East, West.\n\nIf we choose North: Next pos becomes (3,5). From there, options are North, South, East, West.\n\nMoving East from (3,5) leads to (3,6?), which doesn't exist. Max column is 5, so cannot move East anymore.\n\nTherefore, from (3,5), available moves: North, South, West.\n\nSuppose instead, from (4,5), move West twice to (4,3), then see possibilities.\n\nAt (4,3), can move North to (3,3), then continue West to (3,0). That sounds promising!\n\nHold on\u2014is such a path free from obstacles?\n\nCheck each step:\n\nStep-by-step Plan:\n\nMove Sequence: W, W, N, W, W, W ?\n\nNo, hold on\u2014that wouldn't make sense yet. Let me detail properly.\n\nPlan:\n\n1. Starting at (4,5)\n   Possible Moves: N,S,E,W \u2192 E is impossible (column 5+1=6 >5). So choices: N, S, W.\n\nCase 1: Moving West repeatedly.\n\nMoves:\n\nW: (4,4)\nW: (4,3)\nNow, from (4,3), can move North\u2192 (3,3), then keep moving West till (3,0).\n\nThat gives total moves: W, W, N, W, W, W.\n\nTotal Steps: Six steps.\n\nDoes this path interfere with the obstacle at (5,0)?\n\nWell, checking each intermediate node:\n\nAfter Step 1: (4,4) safe.\n\nStep 2: (4,3) safe.\n\nStep 3: (3,3) safe.\n\nThen continuing West three times brings us to (3,0). Each stop enroute is within bounds and non-obstructed.\n\nHence, yes, this works.\n\nHowever, alternative approaches may yield shorter paths, but six steps seem acceptable.\n\nAre there potentially fewer steps needed?\n\nWait, original start is (4,5), destination is (3,0). Manhattan Distance is (change in X)+(change in Y)=|\u22121| + |\u22125|=6. Hence minimal theoretical steps is 6. Thus, my proposed solution uses exactly 6 steps, hence likely optimal.\n\nThus, the path is indeed W, W, N, W, W, W.\n\nConfirming:\n\nEach step:\n\n1. (4,5) \u2192 W \u2192 (4,4)\n2.

The starting point here is (1,1), which according to the instructions where (0,0) is the top-left corner, should be somewhere near the upper middle left part of the grid. My destination is (2,1), just one unit below me but same x-coordinate since it's moving straight down or maybe not? Wait no\u2014wait, wait\u2014the coordinates might actually represent rows as y-axis increasing downwards because usually grids can vary depending on whether they're matrix-like with origin bottom-left or something else... Hmm, perhaps better clarify first what exactly these points mean.\n\nWait, let me think again. In standard Cartesian coordinate systems used for grids sometimes (0,0) is considered the top-left like screen coordinates, meaning higher y-values go downward. So if we consider movement directions:\n\nFrom (1,1):\n\nMoving Up would decrease the y-coordinate.\nMoving Down increases the y-coordinate.\nSimilarly, Right moves along positive x-directions, Left decreases them.\n\nSo given that our start is (1,1)\u2014so assuming zero-based indexing, then going towards lower indices when moving upwards?\n\nBut regardless, my main task is to find an allowed path through the grid considering there\u2019s only one obstacle mentioned: (5,0).\n\nLet me visualize the grid. It's a 6x6 grid, so positions range from (0,0) to (5,5).

That seems straightforward\u2014it could potentially involve either staying put\u2014but obviously, needs some steps.
