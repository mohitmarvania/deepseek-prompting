Find the optimal path in a grid environment, avoiding obstacles while tracking position at each step. Take your time to carefully analyze the grid configuration before planning the path.\n    \n    **Grid Configuration**\n    Size: 6x6\n    Start: (2,1)\n    Goal: (1. 3)\n    Obstacles: [(5,0)]\n    (0,0) is located in the upper-left corner and (5,5) is located at bottom-right corner at 5th row and 5th column.\n    \n    **Constraints**\n    - Allowed Movements: [Up/Down/Right/Left]\n    - left goes from (x-1,y) to (x,y)\n    - right goes from (x,y) to (x+1,y)\n    - up goes from (x,y) to (x,y-1)\n    - down goes from (x,y) to (x,y+1)\n    - Position tracking required\n    \n    **Output Format**\n    <Think>\n    [Your detailed reasoning about obstacle avoidance and path selection]\n    </Think>\n    |summary|\n    optimal Path: [Movements sequence]\n    \n    <Think> \n    Okay, so I need to find an optimal path in this 6x6 grid from start point (2,1) to goal (1,3). The only obstacle given is at (5,0), which seems pretty far away since our starting point is much closer to the top.\n\nFirst off, let me visualize the grid. Since it's 6x6, with coordinates ranging from (0,0) at the top-left to (5,5) at the bottom-right. So moving Up decreases y by 1, Down increases y by 1, Left decreases x by 1, Right increases x by 1.\n\nThe start is at (2,1). Let me note that as S:\n\nS . . .\n. . . .\nU U U O *\n... etc., but wait no\u2014obstacle is just one cell at (5,0).\n\nSo my first thought is whether there\u2019s any direct way or if we have to go around something? But looking at where the obstacle is\u2014it's all the way on the lower edge near the leftmost side. Our start is more towards the middle-top of the grid.\n\nLet me think about possible paths. From (2,1):\n\nPossible moves initially would be Up, Down, Left, Right\u2014but considering boundaries?\n\nWait, can't move beyond certain points because they're out of bounds. For example, trying to move Up when already at y=1 might not make sense unless you want to stay put, but movement requires changing positions.\n\nBut actually, according to allowed movements, maybe staying still isn\u2019t considered; perhaps every move must change direction except for some cases like turning back immediately after stepping somewhere else.\n\nHmm, probably better to model this using BFS\u2014the standard approach for shortest path problems without weights\u2014in grids allowing four directions.\n\nGiven that, here's how I'd proceed mentally:\n\nStart node is (2,1). We'll explore nodes level by level until reaching (1,3).\n\nEach node will track its parent and current position along with steps taken.\n\nAt each step, enqueue neighbors provided they haven't been visited yet and aren't blocked.\n\nObstacle is at (5,0)\u2014so whenever checking neighbor cells, ensure none land on (5,0); also check within grid boundaries.\n\nNow, thinking through levels:\n\nLevel 0: Starting Point (2,1)\n\nFrom here, potential next moves could be:\n\nUp \u2192 (2,0): Is (2,0) accessible? Yes, assuming edges don't block\u2014if rows above exist. Wait, does going below affect anything? No, same applies upwardly.\n\nSimilarly,\n\nDown\u2192(2,2),\n\nLeft\u2192(1,1),\n\nRight\u2192(3,1).\n\nAll these should be valid initial moves.\n\nThen Level 1 consists of those adjacent squares.\n\nProceeding further, each subsequent layer explores deeper into the grid.\n\nI imagine drawing layers outwardwards from the start, expanding north-south-east-west alternately.\n\nSince the target is (1,3), which is two units west-northwest relative to the start\u2014that suggests needing to head generally northwestward.\n\nHowever, due to the presence of the single obstacle blocking part of the grid, especially toward the southern end, do we hit any obstructions early on?\n\nLooking specifically, though, the obstacle is quite low\u2014at (5,0). That means most areas higher than say y=4 won't interfere directly with getting to (1,3). Therefore, primary challenge may lie elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the main issue is ensuring that during traversal, we avoid being stuck anywhere\u2014islanded parts caused by other hidden obstacles\u2014or rather, in this case, just having clear path otherwise.\n\nIn such scenarios, BFS ensures finding the minimal number of steps needed regardless of specific routes\u2014as long as unblocked.\n\nTherefore, proceeding methodically via BFS, keeping track of visited nodes, and exploring them in order allows us to reach the destination optimally.\n\nAnother consideration is symmetry\u2014for instance, sometimes multiple paths lead to the same spot, but once marked as visited, redundant processing stops.\n\nAlso important is that even if alternative longer paths seem available\u2014they\u2019re irrelevant compared to shorter ones found earlier\u2014and thus, prioritizing exploration based on distance minimizes overall computation.\n\nThus, following this systematic approach, eventually arriving at (1,3) gives the desired result.\n\nThinking ahead, what kind of turns would get us there efficiently? Maybe heading North-West several times then adjusting accordingly.\n\nFor example:\n\nMove Up twice: (2,1)->(2,0)? Wait, hold on! Moving Up reduces Y-coordinate. If currently at (2,1), moving Up takes us to (2,0). Then again, another Up brings us to (2,-1), which is invalid\u2014a boundary condition. Hence, cannot keep moving Up past Row 0.\n\nHence, maximum consecutive Ups limited by grid constraints.\n\nInstead, perhaps combining Up/down/left/right appropriately.\n\nPerhaps instead, Move Up once to (2,0), then adjust sideways.\n\nOr alternatively, use combinations of Lefts and Downs.\n\nWait, but why complicate things\u2014I\u2019ll stick to the algorithmic process.\n\nStarting over:\n\nInitialize queue with (2,1). Mark as visited.\n\nDequeue (2,1). Check if it's the goal\u2014we see (1,3) vs (2,1). Not equal.\n\nEnqueue all non-obstructed neighboring cells:\n\nCheck Up: (2,0). Unvisited & not obstructed. Enqueue.\n\nCheck Down: (2,2). Same logic. Enqueue.\n\nCheck Left: (1,1). Also okay. Enqueue.\n\nCheck Right: (3,1). Enqueue too.\n\nMark all enqueued nodes as visited now.\n\nNext iteration: Dequeue (2,0). It hasn't reached the goal yet.\n\nExplore Neighbors:\n\nUp: (2,-1) \u2013 invalid\n\nDown: (2,1) \u2014 already visited\n\nLeft: (1,0) \u2014 new location. Enqueue.\n\nRight: (3,0) \u2014 new. Enqueue.\n\nAdditionally, check obstacle: At (5,0). So neither (1,0) nor (3,0) coincide with obstacle, hence safe.\n\nContinue marking visited.\n\nThird dequeued item: (2,2). Again, not goal.\n\nNeighbors:\n\nUp: (2,1) \u2014 visited\n\nDown: (2,3) \u2014 new. Enqueue.\n\nLeft: (1,2) \u2014 new. Enqueue.\n\nRight: (3,2) \u2014 new. Enqueue.\n\nFourth element: (1,1). Not goal.\n\nExploring:\n\nUp: (1,0) \u2014 was previously added when dequeueing (2,0)?\n\nYes, indeed. So mark as visited upon adding.\n\nDown: (1,2) \u2014 new. Enqueue.\n\nLeft: Can't go further left since x becomes negative.\n\nRight: (2,1) \u2014 already visited.\n\nFifth element: (3,1). Not goal.\n\nExploring:\n\nUp: (3,0) \u2014 already queued.\n\nDown: (3,2) \u2014 new. Enqueue.\n\nLeft: (2,1) \u2014 visited.\n\nRight: (4,1) \u2014 new. Enqueue.\n\nSixth element: (1,0). Not goal.\n\nExploring:\n\nUp: Invalid.\n\nDown: (1,1) \u2014 visited.\n\nLeft: Invalid.\n\nRight: (2,0) \u2014 visited.\n\nSeventh element: (3,0). Not goal.\n\nExploring:\n\nUp: (3,1) \u2014 visited.\n\nDown: (3,-1) \u2014 invalid.\n\nLeft: (2,0) \u2014 visited.\n\nRight: (4,0) \u2014 new. Enqueue.\n\nEighth element: (2,3). Not goal.\n\nExploring:\n\nUp: (2,2) \u2014 visited.\n\nDown: (2,4) \u2014 new. Enqueue.\n\nLeft: (1,3) \u2014 oh!\n\nHold on, (1,3)! Which is exactly the goal.\n\nIs (1,3) reachable from (2,3)'s Left move?\n\nIndeed yes\u2014from (2,3) moving Left gets to (1,3). So that's promising.\n\nBefore confirming, verify if (1,3) has been checked against obstacles\u2014all good.\n\nMoreover, confirm if (2,3) itself wasn't blocked\u2014which shouldn't be the case.\n\nSo therefore, the path exists.\n\nTo reconstruct the path, backtrack from (1,3) to (2,3) to ... ?\n\nWell, tracing back:\n\nGoal is (1,3). Predecessor is (2,3). How did we arrive there? From (2,3), moved Left.\n\nWhat led to (2,3)? Looking back, previous state came from either Up, Down, Left, or Right prior to entering (2,3).\n\nWhen (2,3) was processed, it had come from (2,2) moving Down, correct?\n\nBecause when (2,2) was dequeued, explored neighbors including (2,3) moving Down.\n\nSo predecessor chain continues backward.\n\nContinuing backwards:\n\n(2,3) \u2190 (2,2)\n\nHow arrived at (2,2): Either from Up, Down, Left, or Right.\n\nProcessing (2,2) comes from (2,1) moving Down.\n\nAnd (2,1) was obtained from (1,1) moving Right or similar.\n\nThis reconstruction shows that the path involves moving upwards, downwards between various X-coordinates, and finally taking a Left turn close to the goal.\n\nPutting together the exact sequence needs careful retracing.\n\nAlternative idea: Instead of manually retracing, consider writing code-like pseudocode for BFS, noting parents.\n\nBut since doing it manually, perhaps list the path as follows:\n\nFrom (2,1):\nOption A: Go Up -> (2,0).\nFrom (2,0): Go Right-> (3,0).\nFrom (3,0): Go Down-> (3,1).\nFrom (3,1): Go Right-> (4,1).\nFrom (4,1): Go Right-> (5,1)... Hmm, but (5,0) is blocked, but others?\nNo, perhaps different route.\n\nAlternate Approach:\n\nAfter visiting (2,3), leading to (1,3), trace back:\n\nSequence ends at (1,3)\u2190(2,3)\u2190(2,2)\u2190(2,1). Or possibly branching differently.\n\nActually, depending on the order in which children were enqueued, predecessors vary.\n\nAssuming FIFO nature of queues, the earliest arrival leads to the shortest path.\n\nConsidering that, likely the path uses fewer steps.\n\nPossibly:\n\n(2,1) \u2192 (2,2) \u2192 (2,3) \u2192 (1,3). Three moves total.\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nConfirm validity:\n\nMoving Up from (2,1) to (2,0);\n\nThen Down from (2,0) to (2,1)\u2014wait, nope, that loops.\n\nWait correction: To get to (2,2), from (2,1) moving Down;\n\nThen from (2,2) moving Down to (2,3);\n\nFinally, from (2,3) moving Left to (1,3).\n\nTotal three moves: D, D, L.\n\nWhich translates numerically as per coordinate changes.\n\nCoordinates progression:\n\nStep 0: (2,1)\n\nStep 1: (2,2) -- Down\n\nStep 2: (2,3) -- Down\n\nStep 3: (1,3) -- Left\n\nYep, that works perfectly fine.\n\nChecking for obstacles: None of these intermediate points conflict with (5,0). All are free.\n\nFurthermore, verifying dimensions\u2014are all coordinates within 0<=x<6, 0<=y<6? \n\n(2,1): Valid\n\n(2,2): Valid\n\n(2,3): Valid\n\n(1,3): Valid\n\nPerfecto.\n\nConclusion: Optimal path is moving Down twice followed by a Left move.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nOptimal Path: \\boxed{[D, D, L]}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the path planning problem in a 6x6 grid from the start point (2,1) to the goal (1,3) while avoiding the obstacle at (5,0), we follow these key steps:\n\n1. **Identify Possible Moves**: Initially, from (2,1), the possible moves are Up, Down, Left, and Right. However, moving Up results in (2,0), which is valid.

The grid has some constraints like allowed movements only being Up, Down, Left, Right\u2014no diagonals or anything fancy there. Also, there's one obstacle at (5,0), which means that spot is blocked.\n\nFirst off, let me visualize this grid because it helps me understand where everything is. Since (0,0) is top-left and increases as we go right and down, my starting point is (1,5). That would be second cell from the left on the fifth row if rows are counted from zero? Wait no\u2014if columns increase going right, then y=5 should actually be near the top since higher numbers might mean lower positions depending on how you look at grids sometimes... Hmm maybe not\u2014it depends whether they're using matrix notation with first index for rows increasing downward but here perhaps both x and y can vary independently?\n\nWait wait\u2014the problem says \"Start: (1,5)\" meaning probably x starts at 1 moving towards larger values when going right, same with y; similarly, movement directions:\n\nleft takes us from (x,y) to (x-1,y)\u2014so decreasing x by 1 moves left,\n\nright increases x by 1,\n\nup decreases y by 1,\n\ndown increases y by 1.\n\nSo given that, our coordinate system seems similar to Cartesian coordinates except without negative indices\u2014they just wrap around within bounds of 0 to 5 inclusive.\n\nBut okay, regardless, important thing is mapping out all possible paths considering the single obstacle blocking (5,0).\n\nNow, thinking about standard algorithms used for such problems\u2014I remember BFS (Breadth First Search) is typically used for finding shortest paths in unweighted graphs, especially grid-based environments. So applying BFS makes sense here unless weighted costs complicate things\u2014but in this case, every move counts equally, so yes, BFS will give the minimal number of steps needed.\n\nLet me outline what needs to happen:\n\nStep 1: Represent the Grid\n\nI'll create a representation of the grid including marked obstacles. Each node represents a position (x,y); edges connect nodes based on allowable movements provided none of them lead into an obstacle.\n\nGiven size 6x6, indexes run from 0 to 5 along both axes.\n\nObstacle is at (5,0): so any attempt to reach (5,0) must be avoided.\n\nStarting Point S = (1,5)\n\nGoal G = (5,1)\n\nWe have to plan a path from S to G via adjacent cells, never stepping onto (5,0).\n\nSince BFS explores level by level ensuring the earliest arrival gives the shortest path, it\u2019s suitable here.\n\nPotential Issues:\n\nIs there even a valid path between these points due to the obstacle? Let's see.\n\nLooking at their relative positions: Starting at (1,5), trying to get to (5,1). Without obstructions, Manhattan distance suggests several options\u2014we could potentially snake through various routes either upwards/downwards/left/right combinations.\n\nThe presence of an obstacle at (5,0)... Well, does that block direct access somewhere critical?\n\nFor instance, suppose someone tries to come directly south-west toward the goal\u2014that may pass close to other areas, but specifically, do we hit something?\n\nAlternatively, think about potential dead ends caused by the obstacle.\n\nAnother thought\u2014is the obstacle reachable itself? From (1,5), getting to (5,0):\n\nTo check feasibility, compute minimum steps required ignoring obstacles\u2014which would involve moving east twice more than necessary\u2014or rather, calculate manhattan distance.\n\nManhattan Distance D = |5-1| + |0-5| =4 +5=9 units. But actual path length cannot exceed certain limits...\n\nHowever, specific blocks\u2014for example, if the obstacle creates a barrier preventing progress beyond its location.\n\nIn particular, looking closer, the obstacle is at (5,0). To avoid it, during traversal, whenever approaching (5,0)'s vicinity, ensure not passing through.\n\nPerhaps another way: imagine drawing lines across the grid\u2014from (1,5) to (5,1). Are there any unavoidable crossings over (5,0)?\n\nWell, (5,0) lies far southwest compared to the start and end points. Maybe the straight line isn't obstructed yet.\n\nAlternative approach: try sketching the grid mentally.\n\nRow-wise indexing:\n\nRows 0 to 5 vertically upwardly, assuming typical matrices.\n\nColumns 0 to 5 horizontally.\n\n(1,5) is middle-top-ish area.\n\n(5,1) is middle-bottomish.\n\nFrom (1,5), initial direction choices include North (to decrease y?), East (increase x), South (increase y), West (decrease x)? Wait hold on! Wait according to earlier definitions:\n\nMovement Directions:\n\nleft \u2192 (x\u22121,y),\n\nright\u2192 (x+1,y),\n\nup\u2192 (x,y\u22121),\n\ndown\u2192 (x,y+1).\n\nTherefore, 'up' reduces y-coordinate, whereas 'down' increases it.\n\nSimilarly, 'left' reduces x, 'right' increases x.\n\nThus, navigating from (1,5) requires careful consideration regarding desired direction changes.\n\nOur target is (5,1). Comparatively, current position is (1,5). So difference dx=4, dy=-4.\n\nHence, overall displacement vector is positive delta-x and negative delta-y.\n\nPossible strategies:\n\nMove primarily rightward until reaching maximum x, then adjust downwards accordingly.\n\nOr alternatively, mix rights and downs strategically.\n\nBut also consider the obstacle at (5,0). If attempting to head too low in terms of y-axis early on, risk hitting the obstacle later.\n\nHmm, perhaps better to explore multiple pathways.\n\nBacktracking methodically sounds tedious manually, hence why algorithmic approaches help.\n\nThinking again about BFS process:\n\nInitialize queue with starting position (1,5).

        "optimal_path": "optimal Path: [Movements sequence]\n    \n    <Think> \n    Okay, so I need to find an optimal path from start point (1,5) to goal (5,1) on a 6x6 grid. The grid has some constraints like allowed movements only being Up, Down, Left, Right\u2014no diagonals or anything fancy there. Also, there's one obstacle at (5,0), which means that spot is blocked.\n\nFirst off, let me visualize this grid because it helps me understand where everything is. Since (0,0) is top-left and increases as we go right and down, my starting point is (1,5). That would be second cell from the left on the fifth row if rows are counted from zero? Wait no\u2014if columns increase going right, then y=5 should actually be near the top since higher numbers might mean lower positions depending on how you look at grids sometimes... Hmm maybe not\u2014it depends whether they're using matrix notation with first index for rows increasing downward but here perhaps both x and y can vary independently?\n\nWait wait\u2014the problem says \"Start: (1,5)\" meaning probably x starts at 1 moving towards larger values when going right, same with y; similarly, movement directions:\n\nleft takes us from (x,y) to (x-1,y)\u2014so decreasing x by 1 moves left,\n\nright increases x by 1,\n\nup decreases y by 1,\n\ndown increases y by 1.\n\nSo given that, our coordinate system seems similar to Cartesian coordinates except without negative indices\u2014they just wrap around within bounds of 0 to 5 inclusive.\n\nBut okay, regardless, important thing is mapping out all possible paths considering the single obstacle blocking (5,0).\n\nNow, thinking about standard algorithms used for such problems\u2014I remember BFS (Breadth First Search) is typically used for finding shortest paths in unweighted graphs, especially grid-based environments. So applying BFS makes sense here unless weighted costs complicate things\u2014but in this case, every move counts equally, so yes, BFS will give the minimal number of steps needed.\n\nLet me outline what needs to happen:\n\nStep 1: Represent the Grid\n\nI'll create a representation of the grid including marked obstacles. Each node represents a position (x,y); edges connect nodes based on allowable movements provided none of them lead into an obstacle.\n\nGiven size 6x6, indexes run from 0 to 5 along both axes.\n\nObstacle is at (5,0): so any attempt to reach (5,0) must be avoided.\n\nStarting Point S = (1,5)\n\nGoal G = (5,1)\n\nWe have to plan a path from S to G via adjacent cells, never stepping onto (5,0).\n\nSince BFS explores level by level ensuring the earliest arrival gives the shortest path, it\u2019s suitable here.\n\nPotential Issues:\n\nIs there even a valid path between these points due to the obstacle? Let's see.\n\nLooking at their relative positions: Starting at (1,5), trying to get to (5,1). Without obstructions, Manhattan distance suggests several options\u2014we could potentially snake through various routes either upwards/downwards/left/right combinations.\n\nThe presence of an obstacle at (5,0)... Well, does that block direct access somewhere critical?\n\nFor instance, suppose someone tries to come directly south-west toward the goal\u2014that may pass close to other areas, but specifically, do we hit something?\n\nAlternatively, think about potential dead ends caused by the obstacle.\n\nAnother thought\u2014is the obstacle reachable itself? From (1,5), getting to (5,0):\n\nTo check feasibility, compute minimum steps required ignoring obstacles\u2014which would involve moving east twice more than necessary\u2014or rather, calculate manhattan distance.\n\nManhattan Distance D = |5-1| + |0-5| =4 +5=9 units. But actual path length cannot exceed certain limits...\n\nHowever, specific blocks\u2014for example, if the obstacle creates a barrier preventing progress beyond its location.\n\nIn particular, looking closer, the obstacle is at (5,0). To avoid it, during traversal, whenever approaching (5,0)'s vicinity, ensure not passing through.\n\nPerhaps another way: imagine drawing lines across the grid\u2014from (1,5) to (5,1). Are there any unavoidable crossings over (5,0)?\n\nWell, (5,0) lies far southwest compared to the start and end points. Maybe the straight line isn't obstructed yet.\n\nAlternative approach: try sketching the grid mentally.\n\nRow-wise indexing:\n\nRows 0 to 5 vertically upwardly, assuming typical matrices.\n\nColumns 0 to 5 horizontally.\n\n(1,5) is middle-top-ish area.\n\n(5,1) is middle-bottomish.\n\nFrom (1,5), initial direction choices include North (to decrease y?), East (increase x), South (increase y), West (decrease x)? Wait hold on! Wait according to earlier definitions:\n\nMovement Directions:\n\nleft \u2192 (x\u22121,y),\n\nright\u2192 (x+1,y),\n\nup\u2192 (x,y\u22121),\n\ndown\u2192 (x,y+1).\n\nTherefore, 'up' reduces y-coordinate, whereas 'down' increases it.\n\nSimilarly, 'left' reduces x, 'right' increases x.\n\nThus, navigating from (1,5) requires careful consideration regarding desired direction changes.\n\nOur target is (5,1). Comparatively, current position is (1,5). So difference dx=4, dy=-4.\n\nHence, overall displacement vector is positive delta-x and negative delta-y.\n\nPossible strategies:\n\nMove primarily rightward until reaching maximum x, then adjust downwards accordingly.\n\nOr alternatively, mix rights and downs strategically.\n\nBut also consider the obstacle at (5,0).

Take your time to carefully analyze the grid configuration before planning the path.\n    \n    **Grid Configuration**\n    Size: 6x6\n    Start: (2,0)\n    Goal: (1. 4)\n    Obstacles: [(5,0)]\n    (0,0) is located in the upper-left corner and (5,5) is located at bottom-right corner at 5th row and 5th column.\n    \n    **Constraints**\n    - Allowed Movements: [Up/Down/Right/Left]\n    - left goes from (x-1,y) to (x,y)\n    - right goes from (x,y) to (x+1,y)\n    - up goes from (x,y) to (x,y-1)\n    - down goes from (x,y) to (x,y+1)\n    - Position tracking required\n    \n    **Output Format**\n    <Think>\n    [Your detailed reasoning about obstacle avoidance and path selection]\n    </Think>\n    |summary|\n    optimal Path: [Movements sequence]\n    \n    <Think> \n    Okay, so I need to find an optimal path in this 6x6 grid from start point (2,0) to goal (1,4). The grid has some constraints like allowed movements only being Up, Down, Left, Right\u2014no diagonals or anything fancy there. Also, there's one obstacle at (5,0), which means that spot is blocked.\n\nFirst off, let me visualize the grid because having a clear picture helps with figuring out possible paths. Since it's a 6x6 grid, rows go from 0 to 5 vertically, and columns also from 0 to 5 horizontally. So starting at (2,0)\u2014that would be somewhere on the second column of the topmost row\u2014and needing to get to (1,4), which seems quite far away both vertically and horizontally but maybe manageable since we can move freely as long as we avoid obstacles.\n\nWait, actually hold on\u2014the coordinates might have been misread here. Let me double-check:\n\nThe problem says \"Start: (2,0)\" and \"Goal: (1. 4)\". Hmm, wait\u2014that last part looks odd; did they mean (1,4)? Because after \".4\" it just ends without another number? Maybe it was a typo when writing. Assuming it\u2019s supposed to be (1,4).\n\nSo our start is two units along the x-axis (columns?) Wait no\u2014in grids sometimes people use different notations for axes. But given standard Cartesian-like systems where increasing y moves downward if considering computer graphics, perhaps (row, column)?\n\nBut regardless, assuming movement directions based on typical definitions\u2014if moving 'up' decreases the first coordinate by 1, then probably (y,x) notation isn't used\u2014it depends how you model them.\n\nAlternatively, thinking more clearly, often in programming problems, especially grid-based ones, points are represented as (column, row), meaning (x,y) could correspond directly to matrix indices. For example, (0,0) is usually the top-left, matching matrices where index starts at zero.\n\nGiven that, (2,0): If using (x,y) = (column, row), then yes, same thing applies. Starting at column=2, row=0\u2014which is near the top middle\u2014but depending on whether higher numbers go upwards or downwards.\n\nActually, now getting confused\u2014is (0,0) considered the top-left or bottom-left?\n\nIn many contexts, including game development, (0,0) is typically the top-left corner. Therefore, lower y-values increase going down, similar to screen coordinates.\n\nTherefore, mapping (start_x, start_y)=(2,0):\n\nIf (x increases towards right, y increases toward bottom)\n\nThen positions will look something like:\n\nRow 0: y=0\n\nColumns 0 through 5 across x axis.\n\nSimilarly, Row 5 is the lowest y value.\n\nThus, (2,0) is third cell from the left on the very top row.\n\nAnd the goal is (1,4); i.e., second column from the left on fifth row counting from top\u2014or fourth row from the bottom.\n\nHmm... okay, visualizing such a grid may help figure out potential routes.\n\nNow, the main issue is the single obstacle at (5,0). That blockage affects any attempt to pass through either direction adjacent to it.\n\nLet me think about what areas around the obstacle do we have access to.\n\nAt (5,0), blocking its presence. So cells surrounding it cannot be traversed into unless via alternative pathways.\n\nSince all other cells except these six must remain accessible\u2014I assume everything else is free otherwise.\n\nOur task is to plan a path from (2,0) to (1,4) stepping only on non-obstacle squares, moving only four-directionally.\n\nAlso important note: We're asked specifically for the optimal path, implying shortest path in terms of steps taken.\n\nHence, BFS approach comes mind\u2014as breadth-first search finds the shortest path in unweighted graphs.\n\nHowever, manually doing BFS requires careful consideration.\n\nAlternative idea: Perhaps try drawing the grid mentally and see feasible connections.\n\nStarting Point S=(2,0). From here, initial options are to Move Up, Down, Left, or Right.\n\nFrom (2,0):\nPossible Moves:\n- Up: Would take us beyond the grid boundaries? No, because y-coordinate remains >=0 always. Moving Up from (2,0) leads to (2,-1), which doesn\u2019t exist. Hence invalid. So Up is impossible.\n\n- Down: To (2,1).\n  \n- Left: To (1,0).\n  \n- Right: To (3,0).\n\nObstruction check: None of those immediate next nodes are obstructed\u2014they\u2019re within bounds except possibly others further ahead.\n\nProceeding Step-by-step:\n\nStep 1: At (2,0). Possible Next Steps: D(2,1), L(1,0), R(3,0).\n\nWe'll consider expanding level-wise.\n\nLevel 1 Nodes: (2,1),(1,0),(3,0).\n\nNext Level Expansion:\n\nFor Each node in current level, explore their neighbors excluding already visited and obstructions.\n\nProcessing Node (2,1):\n\nNeighbors:\nU:(2,0)-already visited,\nD:(2,2),\nL:(1,1),\nR:(3,1),\n\nNo obstruction issues yet\u2014all valid.\n\nAdd these new nodes to queue.\n\nCurrent Visited Set includes original plus above.\n\nMoving On,\n\nNode (1,0):\n\nNeighbors:\nU:(1,-1)->invalid,\nD:(1,1),\nL:(0,0),\nR:(2,0)->visited.\n\nCheck if (1,1) is available\u2014yes, add to queue.\n\nAdditionally, adding (0,0) to visited set.\n\nNode (3,0):\n\nNeighbors:\nU:(3,-1)->invalid,\nD:(3,1),\nL:(2,0)->visited,\nR:(4,0).\n\nAll safe, added accordingly.\n\nQueue Now Contains: (2,2), (1,1), (3,1), (0,0), (4,0).\n\nMark All As Visited.\n\nContinue Processing These Nodes In Queue Order.\n\nProcess First Node: (2,2).\n\nIts Neighbors:\n\nU:(2,1)->visited,\nD:(2,3),\nL:(1,2),\nR:(3,2).\n\nThese are all open, proceed.\n\nAdding (2,3), (1,2), (3,2) to queue.\n\nVisited expands.\n\nSecond Node: (1,1).\n\nNeighbors:\n\nU:(1,0)->visited,\nD:(1,2),\nL:(0,1),\nR:(2,1)->visited.\n\nAdd (1,2), (0,1) to queue.\n\nThird Node: (3,1).\n\nNeighbors:\n\nU:(3,0)->visited,\nD:(3,2),\nL:(2,1)->visited,\nR:(4,1).\n\nAdd (3,2), (4,1).\n\nFourth Node: (0,0).\n\nNeighbors:\n\nU:(0,-1)->invalid,\nD:(0,1),\nL:(-1,0)->invalid,\nR:(1,0)->visited.\n\nOnly neighbor is (0,1), which hasn't been processed yet. Add to queue.\n\nFifth Node: (4,0).\n\nNeighbors:\n\nU:(4,-1)->invalid,\nD:(4,1),\nL:(3,0)->visited,\nR:(5,0)->obstacle!\n\nAh! Here lies the obstacle. Trying to move Right from (4,0) takes us to (5,0), which is blocked. Thus, (5,0) is inaccessible due to the obstacle.\n\nTherefore, from (4,0)'s perspective, attempting to move Right results in collision. So instead, remaining viable moves are U,D,L.\n\nWhich translates to checking (4,1), etc.\u2014but processing continues once all previous nodes are done.\n\nAfter processing all five nodes, the queue contains:\n\n(2,3), (1,2), (3,2), (1,2 again?), (0,1), (3,2 again?), (4,1), (0,1 again?), hmm, duplicates occur naturally during expansion.\n\nTo prevent revisiting, mark nodes as visited upon enqueuing.\n\nContinuing until reach target location (1,4).\n\nThis process involves multiple levels of expansions, keeping track of distances.\n\nAn alternative way is to perform BFS layer by layer, ensuring minimal distance.\n\nConsidering computational limits, manual execution becomes tedious, hence better to outline key waypoints.\n\nAnother thought: Given the small size of the grid, trying to map every possible route incrementally makes sense.\n\nLooking back, the target is (1,4). Which is relatively high in Y-coordinates compared to the start.\n\nPerhaps exploring upward initially allows reaching higher Y values faster.\n\nGoing Backwards Approach: Sometimes working backwards from the end can reveal shorter paths.\n\nTarget is (1,4). What precedes it?\n\nPrevious Positions Could Be:\n\nMove Up: Not applicable, since (1,4) moved up would require negative Y.\n\nMove Down: (1,5)\u2014if exists.\n\nMove Left: (0,4).\n\nMove Right: (2,4).\n\nAssuming (1,5) is outside the grid (since max Y is 5, indexing from 0\u20135 inclusive?)\n\nYes, maximum Y is 5, thus (1,5) is edge case.\n\nIs (1,5) inside? Yes, per definition, dimensions allow Y=5.\n\nWait, hang on: Grid is defined as 6x6, so indexes run from 0 to 5 in X and Y respectively.\n\nMeaning (X,Y)= (0..5 , 0..5 )\n\nThus, (1,5) is indeed reachable.\n\nSo predecessors of Target include (1,5), (0,4), (2,4).\n\nNeed to determine if any of these lead closer to the start.\n\nWorking backward, perhaps identifying layers.\n\nLayer 0: (1,4)\n\nLayer 1: Predecessors mentioned above.\n\nEach subsequent layer adds predecessor nodes recursively.\n\nOnce a node reaches Layer n connected to the start, return the accumulated path length.\n\nBut integrating this method needs thoroughness.\n\nAlternately, perhaps focusing on finding a direct path.\n\nObservation: The obstacle blocks certain avenues\u2014for instance, preventing passage through (5,0). However, looking at the grid, most regions should still connect.\n\nPotential Route Idea:\n\nGo straight up from (2,0) \u2192 (2,1)\u2192\u2026\u2192(2,4). Then turn left to (1,4). Is that possible?\n\nChecking feasibility:\n\nFrom (2,0) -> (2,1)(step1), (2,2)(step2), (2,3)(step3), (2,4)(step4). Then turning left to (1,4)(step5). Total steps:5.\n\nDoes this path encounter any obstacles?\n\nWell, none of the intermediate nodes seem to interfere\u2014with the exception of (5,0). Our path does not involve passing through (5,0), nor nearby spots.\n\nIndeed, (2,4) is safely navigated over.\n\nMoreover, (1,4) is desired destination.\n\nThat gives a total of 5 steps\u2014a pretty short path.\n\nBut is this correct?\n\nWait, let me verify.\n\nMovement Sequence:\n\nS=(2,0)\n\nM1: Up => (2,1)\n\nM2: Up => (2,2)\n\nM3: Up => (2,3)\n\nM4: Up => (2,4)\n\nM5: Left => (1,4)\n\nTotal steps:5.\n\nSeems straightforward.\n\nAre there any hidden obstacles between these points?\n\nLooking at the entire path:\n\nNodes passed: (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4).\n\nNone of these coincide with the obstacle at (5,0). So nothing wrong here.\n\nFurthermore, the path uses vertical movement followed by lateral shift\u2014so efficient.\n\nCould there be even a shorter path? Unlikely, since Manhattan Distance from (2,0) to (1,4) is |2\u22121| + |0\u22124|=1+4=5 steps minimum.\n\nBecause in grid navigation allowing diagonal movement, the minima reduces, but here restricted to orthogonal.\n\nHence, 5 steps is indeed the minimal necessary.\n\nConclusion: This is likely the optimal path requiring exactly 5 steps.\n\nDouble-checking for any missed possibilities.\n\nAlternate Paths Considered:\n\nWhat if taking a detour avoids crossing potentially problematic zones?\n\nE.g.: Instead of climbing all the way up to (2,4), perhaps divert earlier.\n\nSuppose from (2,0) move right twice, then up thrice...\n\nWait, let's compute:\n\nOption A: (2,0) \u2192 (3,0) \u2192 (4,0) \u2013 but stuck because (5,0) is blocked. Can't cross past (4,0) to (5,0). Alternatively, from (4,0), can't move right anymore.\n\nInstead, from (4,0), can move up/down/left.\n\nBut moving up from (4,0) gets to (4,1), which is fine.\n\nBut proceeding from (4,0) won't bring us close enough to (1,4) quickly.\n\nWhereas Option B: Going purely northward achieves the target quicker.\n\nOther Options:\n\nMaybe combining east-west movement early on.\n\nLike: (2,0) \u2192 (1,0) \u2192 ... ?\n\nBut (1,0) is farther south than needed\u2014we'd have to climb several times anyway.\n\nComparatively longer.\n\nSame logic holds for westward movement\u2014wouldn't make progress towards the goal.\n\nHence, the proposed path is superior.\n\nFinal Conclusion: Optimal path consists of moving up three times consecutively, then left once\u2014to achieve the objective in five steps.\n\n**Summary**\n\nOptimal Path: [Up, Up, Up, Up, Left]\n\nPositions Traversed: \n\n1. (2,0) \u2192 (2,1) \u2014 Up\n2. (2,1) \u2192 (2,2) \u2014 Up\n3. (2,2) \u2192 (2,3) \u2014 Up\n4. (2,3) \u2192 (2,4) \u2014 Up\n5. (2,4) \u2192 (1,4) \u2014 Left\n\nThis path efficiently navigates around the obstacle at (5,0) without encountering any hindrances and arrives at the goal in the fewest steps possible.\n</think>\n\n<think>\n\nAlright, let's break down the solution systematically.\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe have a 6x6 grid with specific start and goal positions, and an obstacle. The challenge is to navigate from the start to the goal in the least number of steps, adhering to movement rules and avoiding the obstacle.\n\n#### Key Points:\n- **Grid Dimensions**: 6x6, indexed from (0,0) at the top-left to (5,5) at the bottom-right.\n- **Start Position**: (2,0)\n- **Goal Position**: (1,4)\n- **Obstacle**: Located at (5,0), making that cell impassable.\n\n### Movement Constraints\n- Only allowed to move Up, Down, Left, or Right.\n- Tracking each position at every step ensures completeness.\n\n### Intuition & Strategy\nThe primary strategy is Breadth-First Search (BFS), ideal for finding the shortest path in unweighted grids. Manual application of BFS reveals the quickest route.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n1. **Initial Setup**: Begin at (2,0). Explore all possible moves (Up, Down, Left, Right).\n   - Cannot move Up (out of bounds).\n   - Potential moves: Down to (2,1), Left to (1,0), Right to (3,0).\n\n2. **Expand Levels Systematically**:\n   - Process each node level by level, marking visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n   - Observe that moving strictly Up minimizes steps significantly.\n\n3. **Identify Optimal Path**:\n   - Climbing Up repeatedly brings proximity to the goal.\n   - After ascending to (2,4), a Left move lands precisely at (1,4).\n\n4. **Verify Feasibility**:\n   - Check each segment against obstacles. The chosen path circumvents the obstacle at (5,0).\n\n### Summary\nBy prioritizing vertical ascent and strategic lateral shifts, the optimal path emerges efficiently.\n\n</think>\n\n---\n\n**Answer:**  \nOptimal Path: [Up, Up, Up, Up, Left]  \n\nPositions Traversed:  \n1.

Unlikely, since Manhattan Distance from (2,0) to (1,4) is |2\u22121| + |0\u22124|=1+4=5 steps minimum.\n\nBecause in grid navigation allowing diagonal movement, the minima reduces, but here restricted to orthogonal.\n\nHence, 5 steps is indeed the minimal necessary.\n\nConclusion: This is likely the optimal path requiring exactly 5 steps.\n\nDouble-checking for any missed possibilities.\n\nAlternate Paths Considered:\n\nWhat if taking a detour avoids crossing potentially problematic zones?\n\nE.g.: Instead of climbing all the way up to (2,4), perhaps divert earlier.\n\nSuppose from (2,0) move right twice, then up thrice...\n\nWait, let's compute:\n\nOption A: (2,0) \u2192 (3,0) \u2192 (4,0) \u2013 but stuck because (5,0) is blocked. Can't cross past (4,0) to (5,0). Alternatively, from (4,0), can't move right anymore.\n\nInstead, from (4,0), can move up/down/left.\n\nBut moving up from (4,0) gets to (4,1), which is fine.\n\nBut proceeding from (4,0) won't bring us close enough to (1,4) quickly.\n\nWhereas Option B: Going purely northward achieves the target quicker.\n\nOther Options:\n\nMaybe combining east-west movement early on.\n\nLike: (2,0) \u2192 (1,0) \u2192 ... ?\n\nBut (1,0) is farther south than needed\u2014we'd have to climb several times anyway.\n\nComparatively longer.\n\nSame logic holds for westward movement\u2014wouldn't make progress towards the goal.\n\nHence, the proposed path is superior.\n\nFinal Conclusion: Optimal path consists of moving up three times consecutively, then left once\u2014to achieve the objective in five steps.\n\n**Summary**\n\nOptimal Path: [Up, Up, Up, Up, Left]\n\nPositions Traversed: \n\n1. (2,0) \u2192 (2,1) \u2014 Up\n2. (2,1) \u2192 (2,2) \u2014 Up\n3. (2,2) \u2192 (2,3) \u2014 Up\n4. (2,3) \u2192 (2,4) \u2014 Up\n5. (2,4) \u2192 (1,4) \u2014 Left\n\nThis path efficiently navigates around the obstacle at (5,0) without encountering any hindrances and arrives at the goal in the fewest steps possible.\n</think>\n\n<think>\n\nAlright, let's break down the solution systematically.\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe have a 6x6 grid with specific start and goal positions, and an obstacle. The challenge is to navigate from the start to the goal in the least number of steps, adhering to movement rules and avoiding the obstacle.\n\n#### Key Points:\n- **Grid Dimensions**: 6x6, indexed from (0,0) at the top-left to (5,5) at the bottom-right.\n- **Start Position**: (2,0)\n- **Goal Position**: (1,4)\n- **Obstacle**: Located at (5,0), making that cell impassable.\n\n### Movement Constraints\n- Only allowed to move Up, Down, Left, or Right.\n- Tracking each position at every step ensures completeness.\n\n### Intuition & Strategy\nThe primary strategy is Breadth-First Search (BFS), ideal for finding the shortest path in unweighted grids. Manual application of BFS reveals the quickest route.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n1. **Initial Setup**: Begin at (2,0). Explore all possible moves (Up, Down, Left, Right).\n   - Cannot move Up (out of bounds).\n   - Potential moves: Down to (2,1), Left to (1,0), Right to (3,0).\n\n2. **Expand Levels Systematically**:\n   - Process each node level by level, marking visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n   - Observe that moving strictly Up minimizes steps significantly.\n\n3. **Identify Optimal Path**:\n   - Climbing Up repeatedly brings proximity to the goal.\n   - After ascending to (2,4), a Left move lands precisely at (1,4).\n\n4. **Verify Feasibility**:\n   - Check each segment against obstacles. The chosen path circumvents the obstacle at (5,0).\n\n### Summary\nBy prioritizing vertical ascent and strategic lateral shifts, the optimal path emerges efficiently.\n\n</think>\n\n---\n\n**Answer:**  \nOptimal Path: [Up, Up, Up, Up, Left]  \n\nPositions Traversed:  \n1.
