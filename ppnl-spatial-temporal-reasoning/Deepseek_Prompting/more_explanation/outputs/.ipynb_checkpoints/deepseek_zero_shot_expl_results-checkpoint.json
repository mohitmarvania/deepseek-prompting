The only obstacle given is at (5,0), which seems pretty far away since our starting point is much closer to the top.\n\nFirst off, let me visualize the grid. Since it's 6x6, with coordinates going from (0,0) at the top-left to (5,5) at the bottom-right. So moving Up decreases y by 1, Down increases y by 1, Left decreases x by 1, Right increases x by 1.\n\nThe start is at (2,1). Let me note that as S. And the goal is at (1,3), marked as G. There\u2019s one obstacle at (5,0); O(5,0).\n\nI think using BFS would be ideal here because we want the shortest path without considering any weights or costs\u2014so breadth-first search ensures minimal steps.\n\nLet me outline possible moves:\n\nFrom (2,1):\nPossible directions are Up, Down, Left, Right.\n\nBut wait, what do these mean? For example, if you're facing North, then Up might correspond differently depending on how movement works... Wait no\u2014the problem defines movements clearly:\n\n- Up: decrease y by 1 \u2192 e.g., (x, y-1)\n- Down: increase y by 1 \u2192 (x, y+1)\nWait hold on\u2014that can't be correct for grids usually where rows go downward but maybe they have their own coordinate system?\n\nHold on, perhaps there was confusion between standard Cartesian vs matrix indices. In some systems, increasing y could move downwards like matrices whereas others use different conventions.\n\nLooking back at instructions: \"left goes from (x,y) to (x,y-1)\", meaning decreasing y when moving left; similarly, \"right\" increments y. Hmm, actually, now I'm confused\u2014is 'up' equivalent to north direction typically associated with lower y values or higher ones?\n\nIn typical computer graphics, often origin starts at top-left, and moving down increases y-coordinate. But according to the instruction definitions:\n\nMoving UP = subtracting 1 from y,\nDOWN adds +1,\n\nSo yes\u2014if someone says moving up reduces y, similar to screen coordinates where upwards means towards smaller numbers vertically.\n\nTherefore, assuming that (y=0) is the first row (topmost?), and y increases as we go down into subsequent rows.\n\nSimilarly, x=0 is the first column (leftmost?) and x increases as we move rightwards through columns.\n\nGiven that, my initial understanding holds.\n\nNow, looking again at positions:\n\nStart is (2,1): second column (from zero-based index, third cell horizontally), first row after the top-most.\n\nGoal is (1,3): first column, fourth row counting from top.\n\nObstacle is at (5,0)\u2014fifth column, very last row near the bottom edge.\n\nHmm, okay.\n\nSince the obstacle is quite low on the grid, probably not blocking most of the paths except those approaching the bottom side.\n\nOur task is just to get from (2,1) to (1,3) via allowed movements, keeping track of every position visited along the way.\n\nTo plan optimally, i.e., finding the least number of steps needed, BFS should work perfectly\u2014it explores all nodes level by level until reaching the target node.\n\nStarting Point: (2,1)\n\nLevel 0: (2,1)\n\nNeighbors:\n\nCheck four directions:\n\nUP: From (2,1) -> (2,0). Is (2,0) blocked? No, unless specified otherwise\u2014but the only obstacle listed is (5,0). So safe.\n\nDOWN: To (2,2). Also unblocked.\n\nLEFT: To (1,1). Unblocked.\n\nRIGHT: To (3,1). Unblocked.\n\nThus Level 1 includes (2,0), (2,2), (1,1), (3,1).\n\nProceeding further...\n\nEach next level will explore neighbors of current nodes, ensuring we don\u2019t revisit already explored areas\u2014which helps prevent loops and redundant processing.\n\nIt may take several levels, but due to small grid size, manageable manually.\n\nAlternatively, thinking algorithmically, once implemented correctly, BFS guarantees the shortest path regardless of complexity.\n\nPotential issue though\u2014are certain routes getting stuck around the obstacle? Well, the obstacle is at (5,0), which isn't directly adjacent to the start nor close enough to block multiple pathways early on.\n\nHence, likely straightforward path exists either moving primarily upward/downward/left/right toward the destination.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe trying to reach the same row/column as the goal earlier than other approaches.\n\nFor instance, aiming to reduce y-coordinate to match the goal's y=3\u2014or rather, adjust both x and y accordingly.\n\nWait, the goal has x=1, y=3 compared to start x=2, y=1.\n\nWe need to change x from 2\u21921 (-1) and y from 1\u21923 (+2). So net changes \u0394x=-1, \u0394y=+2 over total distance sqrt((-1)^2+(2)^2)=sqrt(5))\u22484.47 units, implying minimum 5 steps? Or more accurately, Manhattan distance is |-1| + |2|=3 steps, but actual Euclidean requires longer.\n\nHowever, since movement is restricted to orthogonal steps, the minimal number of steps must equal maximum(|\u0394x|, |\u0394y|)*something\u2014I recall that in such cases, sometimes the minimal steps involve combining horizontal and vertical moves appropriately.\n\nActually, in terms of graph theory, the minimal path length equals the sum of absolute differences divided by something else\u2026 Actually, no\u2014for grid graphs allowing diagonal moves, it'd differ, but here diagonals aren't permitted\u2014we\u2019re confined to axis-aligned edges.\n\nAh! Therefore, the minimal number of steps is indeed max(|\u0394x|, |\u0394y|). Here, delta_x is 1 unit difference (since 2->1 is minus 1), delta_y is plus two. Thus min_steps=max(1,2)=2 steps? That doesn't make sense because even in straight line, you\u2019d require three steps: say, right twice and up once, but arranged properly.\n\nNo, sorry, wrong approach. Because in reality, each step allows changing either x or y by \u00b11 per step. Hence, the minimal number of steps is simply the Manhattan Distance / cost per step\u2014in this case, each step counts as single movement whether X or Y changed.\n\nManhattan distance is |delta_x| + |delta_y|. Which gives us 1 + 2 = 3 steps. However, in practice, arranging them depends upon available space.\n\nIs there a direct route within 3 steps? Probably not necessarily, especially with potential obstructions elsewhere.\n\nMoreover, another consideration is whether the path crosses the obstacle area somewhere midway.\n\nIf the obstacle were nearby, it could cause detours requiring additional steps beyond the theoretical minimal.\n\nHere, however, the obstacle is at (5,0), which is relatively distant from the start and end points.\n\nMeaning, the main challenge won't come from collision detection but possibly from choosing among various alternative paths.\n\nPerhaps exploring specific options:\n\nOption A: Move Up initially\n\nFrom (2,1):\n\nStep 1: (2,0) \u2013 Not blocked.\n\nThen Step 2: Can proceed Up again to (2,-1)? Wait, negative indexes aren't valid. So cannot go below y=0.\n\nAlternative Option B: Instead of stepping Up immediately, consider moving Left or Right.\n\nMaybe moving Left brings us closer to the goal's x-direction.\n\nAt (2,1)->(1,1) \u2014 Moving Left gets us to Column 1 instead of staying at Column 2.\n\nThat might help in reducing x quickly.\n\nAfter that, proceeding Up or Down.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps taking a Left turn sooner leads to better progress towards the goal.\n\nTrying out this idea:\n\nMove Sequence:\n\n1. (2,1) \u2192 LEFT \u2192 (1,1)\n\n2. Now at (1,1). Next possibilities include Up, Down, Left, Right.\n\n   If we try to move Up: (1,0). Then potentially continue Up.\n\nOr alternatively, move Right to return to (2,1)... but that wouldn't be efficient.\n\nAlternatively, moving Down to (1,2).\n\nWhich option is better?\n\nGoing Up from (1,1) takes us to Row above, which is less desired since the goal is at Row 3.\n\nWait, hang on: Our goal is at (1,3), which is higher y-value. So moving Up lowers y, making us farther from the goal.\n\nConversely, moving Down raises y, bringing us closer.\n\nTherefore, from (1,1), moving DOWN makes sense\u2014to head towards the goal location.\n\nContinuing:\n\nSequence Steps:\n\n1. (2,1) \u2192 LEFT \u2192 (1,1)\n\n2. (1,1) \u2192 DOWN \u2192 (1,2)\n\nNext, from (1,2), possible moves:\n\nUP: (1,1) \u2013 Backtrack, bad.\n\nDOWN: (1,3) \u2013 Directly reaches the goal!\n\nYes, perfect. So overall, the path becomes:\n\n(2,1) \u2192 (1,1) \u2192 (1,2) \u2192 (1,3)\n\nThree steps in total\u2014a clear path.\n\nChecking for obstacles: None obstructed during traversal\u2014all cells passed are free.\n\nIndeed, the obstacle is at (5,0), nowhere near this path.\n\nConclusion: This simple L-shaped path avoids the obstacle entirely and arrives efficiently at the goal.\n\nJust verifying feasibility:\n\nAre all intermediate cells accessible?\n\n(2,1) is start.\n\n(1,1): Valid, no issues.\n\n(1,2): Valid, also fine.\n\n(1,3): Goal reached successfully.\n\nAll good.\n\nAn alternative path could be moving Up first, but that would lead past (2,0), needing extra steps later, thus resulting in longer path lengths.\n\nE.g.: \n\n(2,1) \u2192 UP \u2192 (2,0),\n\nthen RIGHT \u00d72 times to (3,0),(4,0), etc.\u2014but that complicates things unnecessarily.\n\nWhereas following the L-shape keeps everything smooth.\n\nAdditionally, since the obstacle is too far away, it does not interfere with any viable short paths.\n\nFinal conclusion: Optimal path consists of moving Left once, then Down thrice\u2014not exactly, correction: After moving Left, moved Down twice\u2014from (1,1) to (1,2) to (1,3).
